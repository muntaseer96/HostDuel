Thinking about switching web hosts? The number one question is: how long will this take?

The short answer: **24-72 hours total**, with most of that being DNS propagation (the waiting part). The actual work takes 1-4 hours.

Here's a detailed timeline so you can plan your migration without surprises.

## Quick Answer: Migration Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Preparation | 30-60 minutes | Backups, account setup |
| Migration | 1-4 hours | Moving files and database |
| Testing | 30-60 minutes | Verifying everything works |
| DNS Switch | 5 minutes | Pointing domain to new host |
| DNS Propagation | 24-48 hours | Internet updating globally |
| **Total** | **24-72 hours** | Most is passive waiting |

The hands-on work is 2-6 hours. The rest is waiting for DNS to propagate worldwide.

## Phase 1: Preparation (30-60 Minutes)

Before you migrate anything, you need to prepare.

### Tasks in This Phase

1. **Sign up with new host** (10-15 min)
   - Create account
   - Choose plan
   - Complete payment

2. **Access both hosting accounts** (5 min)
   - Log into old host cPanel
   - Log into new host cPanel
   - Note credentials for both

3. **Create full backup** (15-30 min)
   - Download all website files
   - Export database
   - Save email if applicable

4. **Document current setup** (10 min)
   - Note PHP version
   - Record database details
   - Screenshot DNS settings

### Time-Saving Tip

Most of this can be done days before your actual migration. Get your new hosting account ready, make backups, and document everything in advance.

## Phase 2: Migration (1-4 Hours)

This is the actual moving part. Time varies based on method and site size.

### Option A: Host's Free Migration Service

**Time: 24-72 hours (but passive)**

Many hosts offer free migration:
- [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) - Free professional migration
- [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) - Free with migration plugin
- [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) - Free premium migration
- [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) - Free site transfer

**Process:**
1. Submit migration request (10 min)
2. Provide old host credentials (5 min)
3. Wait for completion email (24-72 hours)
4. Review and approve

**Your active time:** ~15 minutes
**Total time:** 1-3 days

### Option B: Plugin Migration (WordPress)

**Time: 30 minutes - 2 hours**

Using All-in-One WP Migration or Duplicator:

1. **Export from old host** (15-30 min)
   - Install migration plugin
   - Create export package
   - Download file

2. **Import to new host** (15-45 min)
   - Install fresh WordPress
   - Install migration plugin
   - Upload and import package

3. **Verify and cleanup** (15-30 min)
   - Check all pages
   - Update permalinks
   - Delete installer files

**Your active time:** 1-2 hours
**Total time:** 1-2 hours

### Option C: Manual Migration

**Time: 2-4 hours**

For non-WordPress or when you want full control:

1. **Download files via FTP** (30-60 min)
   - Depends on site size
   - 1GB site ≈ 30-60 minutes

2. **Export database** (5-10 min)
   - Via phpMyAdmin
   - Larger databases take longer

3. **Upload files to new host** (30-60 min)
   - Same as download time
   - Upload speed matters

4. **Import database** (5-15 min)
   - Create new database
   - Import SQL file

5. **Update configuration** (15-30 min)
   - Edit config files
   - Update database credentials
   - Test connections

**Your active time:** 2-4 hours
**Total time:** 2-4 hours

### Site Size Impact

| Site Size | Download Time | Upload Time | Total Transfer |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| Small (under 100MB) | 5-10 min | 10-15 min | 15-25 min |
| Medium (100MB-500MB) | 15-30 min | 20-45 min | 35-75 min |
| Large (500MB-2GB) | 30-60 min | 45-90 min | 75-150 min |
| Very Large (2GB+) | 1-2+ hours | 2-3+ hours | 3-5+ hours |

**Pro tip:** Compress files before transfer to reduce time significantly.

## Phase 3: Testing (30-60 Minutes)

Don't skip this. Testing before switching DNS prevents disasters.

### How to Test Without Switching DNS

**Method 1: Edit Hosts File**

Add your new server's IP to your local hosts file:

```
123.456.789.000  yourdomain.com
123.456.789.000  www.yourdomain.com
```

Now only your computer sees the new server. Test everything.

**Method 2: Temporary URL**

Most hosts provide a temporary URL:
- `yourusername.sg1.hosting.com`
- `temp-domain.hostinger.com`
- Server IP directly

Test your site using this URL.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All pages accessible
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Forms submit successfully
- [ ] E-commerce cart works
- [ ] User login functions
- [ ] Admin area accessible
- [ ] SSL certificate works
- [ ] Email sending works
- [ ] No broken links

**Time needed:** 30-60 minutes depending on site complexity.

## Phase 4: DNS Switch (5 Minutes)

Once testing passes, point your domain to the new host.

### Changing Nameservers

1. Log into domain registrar
2. Find nameserver settings
3. Replace with new host's nameservers
4. Save changes

**Time:** 5 minutes active work

### Changing A Record

1. Log into DNS management
2. Find A record for @ and www
3. Update IP address to new host
4. Save changes

**Time:** 5 minutes active work

## Phase 5: DNS Propagation (24-48 Hours)

This is the waiting period. There's nothing you can do to speed this up significantly.

### What Is DNS Propagation?

When you change DNS settings, that change needs to spread across the internet's DNS servers worldwide. Each server caches DNS records and updates at different intervals.

### Propagation Timeline

| Timeframe | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| 0-2 hours | Your ISP may see the change |
| 2-8 hours | Major regions update |
| 8-24 hours | Most of the world updated |
| 24-48 hours | Virtually everyone updated |
| 48-72 hours | Even slow DNS servers updated |

### During Propagation

**What you'll experience:**
- Some visitors see old host
- Some visitors see new host
- This is normal and expected

**What to do:**
- Keep both hosts active
- Don't make changes on either site
- Monitor for issues

### Factors Affecting Propagation Speed

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| TTL (Time to Live) | Lower TTL = faster propagation |
| DNS provider | Some update faster |
| Geographic location | Varies by region |
| ISP | Some cache aggressively |

### How to Check Propagation

Use these free tools:
- [whatsmydns.net](https://whatsmydns.net) - Check global propagation
- [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) - Multiple location check
- [mxtoolbox.com](https://mxtoolbox.com) - DNS lookup

## Reducing Total Migration Time

### 1. Lower TTL Before Migration

If you control DNS, lower TTL to 300 (5 minutes) 24-48 hours before migration. This reduces propagation time.

**Default TTL:** 86400 seconds (24 hours)
**Pre-migration TTL:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)

After migration completes, raise TTL back to normal.

### 2. Use Host's Migration Service

Free migrations handle everything. You just wait for the email.

**Best for:**
- Non-technical users
- Large/complex sites
- When you can't risk errors

### 3. Migrate During Low-Traffic Periods

Check your analytics for lowest traffic times:
- Late night/early morning
- Weekends (for B2B sites)
- Off-season periods

### 4. Prepare Everything in Advance

Before migration day:
- New host account ready
- Backups completed
- Documentation done
- Testing plan prepared

This reduces active migration time significantly.

## FAQ

### Can I switch hosts without downtime?

Yes, if done correctly. By keeping both hosts active during propagation and only switching DNS after the new site is ready, downtime is zero or negligible (seconds during DNS propagation).

### Why does DNS take so long to propagate?

DNS servers worldwide cache records to reduce load. Each server updates on its own schedule (based on TTL). There's no central "push" system—changes spread gradually as caches expire.

### Can I speed up DNS propagation?

Partially. Lowering TTL before migration helps, but you can't force every DNS server to update immediately. Plan for 24-48 hours regardless.

### Should I cancel my old hosting immediately?

No. Keep old hosting active for at least 48-72 hours after DNS switch. This ensures visitors using slow-updating DNS servers still reach a working site.

### What if something goes wrong during migration?

This is why you keep the old host active. If issues arise, you can switch DNS back to the old host while troubleshooting. Always maintain backups.

### How long should I keep both hosting accounts?

Minimum 48-72 hours after DNS switch. Once propagation is complete and everything works on the new host, you can cancel the old one.

### Does using a CDN affect migration time?

CDNs like Cloudflare can actually make DNS changes faster since you're only changing the origin IP, not public DNS. But you still need to update CDN settings.

## When to Avoid Migrating

Don't migrate during:

- **Product launches** - Traffic is unpredictable
- **Marketing campaigns** - Can't risk downtime
- **Holiday periods** - Support may be slower
- **When rushed** - Mistakes happen under pressure

Plan migrations for calm periods when you have time to troubleshoot if needed.

## Summary: Realistic Time Expectations

| Migration Type | Active Work | Total Time |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Host's free migration | 15-30 min | 2-4 days |
| Plugin migration | 1-2 hours | 24-48 hours |
| Manual migration | 2-4 hours | 24-48 hours |
| Large/complex site | 4-8 hours | 48-72 hours |

For most small-medium sites, expect **2-3 hours of work** spread over **2-3 days** of elapsed time.
