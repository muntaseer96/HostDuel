Your hosting provider is your first line of defense against hackers. The right host includes security features that protect your site without extra cost or effort.

Here's what security features your web hosting should include—and which hosts actually deliver.

## Essential Security Features (Must-Have)

### 1. Free SSL Certificate

**What it does:** Encrypts data between your visitors and your server.

**Why it matters:**

## What Your Host Can't Protect Against

Hosting security has limits. Your host can't protect against:

**1. Weak passwords**
Use strong, unique passwords. Enable 2FA.

**2. Vulnerable plugins/themes**
Keep everything updated. Use reputable sources.

**3. User error**
Training and careful practices matter.

**4. Phishing attacks**
No technical solution prevents clicking malicious links.

**5. Insider threats**
Control who has access to what.

### Your Responsibility

Even with great hosting security, you need:

- Strong passwords for WordPress admin
- Regular updates (WordPress, plugins, themes)
- Limited admin users
- Security plugin (Wordfence, Solid Security)
- Regular backups (your own, in addition to host)

## Evaluating Host Security

### Questions to Ask

1. **What backup frequency and retention?**
2. **Is SSL included and automatic?**
3. **What firewall/WAF protection exists?**
4. **Is there malware scanning and removal?**
5. **What happens if I get hacked?** (Support level, cost)
6. **Is 2FA available?**
7. **What's the account isolation method?**

### Red Flags

- SSL costs extra
- No automatic backups
- No mention of security features
- "Security add-on" upsells everywhere
- Poor response to security questions
- History of breaches

### Green Flags

- Security features prominently listed
- Transparent security practices

### Do I need a security plugin if my host has security features?

Yes. Host security and site security work together:
- **Host security:** Server-level, network, infrastructure
- **Security plugin:** Application-level, login protection, malware scanning

They complement each other, not replace each other.

### What's the most important security feature?

**Backups.** When everything else fails, backups let you recover. You can rebuild from a backup. You can't rebuild without one.

### Is Cloudflare necessary if my host has security?

Not necessary, but beneficial. Cloudflare adds:
- DDoS protection layer
- WAF (Pro and above)
- Bot protection
- CDN performance
- Extra redundancy

For free, it's worth adding. The free tier provides meaningful security improvements.

### How do I know if my host is secure?

1. Check their security feature list
2. Look for security certifications
3. Search for breach history
4. Read recent reviews mentioning security
5. Ask support specific security questions

### What should I do after a hack?

1. Contact your host immediately
2. Don't panic—document everything
3. Restore from clean backup
4. Change all passwords
5. Scan for malware
6. Identify entry point
7. Patch vulnerabilities
8. Monitor closely afterward
