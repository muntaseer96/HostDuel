Discovering your website has been hacked is terrifying. But don't panic. With the right steps, you can recover your site and prevent it from happening again.

Here's exactly what to do when your website gets hacked.

## Signs Your Site Was Hacked

### Obvious Signs

- Website redirects to spam/porn sites
- Strange content appearing on pages
- Google shows "This site may be hacked" warning
- Hosting account suspended for malware
- Visitors report malware warnings
- Admin login doesn't work

### Less Obvious Signs

- Unexpected new admin users
- Modified files (check file dates)
- Slow site performance
- Unknown plugins installed
- Outgoing spam from your server
- Strange entries in server logs
- New .htaccess rules you didn't add

## Immediate Actions (First 30 Minutes)

### Step 1: Don't Panic, Document

Before touching anything:

1. **Screenshot everything** - Error messages, strange content
2. **Note the time** you discovered the hack
3. **Check when it started** - Look at file modification dates
4. **List symptoms** - What's wrong exactly?

### Step 2: Take Your Site Offline

Prevent further damage and protect visitors:

**Option A: Maintenance mode**
Create `maintenance.html` and redirect:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Site Maintenance</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Site Under Maintenance</h1>
<p>We'll be back shortly.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Option B: Password protect** via .htaccess

**Option C: Ask host to suspend** (they may have already)

### Step 3: Change All Passwords Immediately

Change these NOW:

- [ ] WordPress admin password
- [ ] Database password (update wp-config.php)
- [ ] FTP/SFTP password
- [ ] Hosting control panel password
- [ ] Any connected service passwords

**Use strong, unique passwords for each.**

### Step 4: Contact Your Host

Notify your hosting provider:
- They may have logs showing when/how it happened
- They can scan for malware
- They may have clean backups
- They'll want to know to protect other customers

## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Restore from Clean Backup (Fastest)

**If you have a backup from before the hack:**

1. **Identify when hack started** - File dates, logs, Google's cache
2. **Find backup before that date**
3. **Download backup for safekeeping**
4. **Restore to hosting:**
   - Restore files
   - Restore database
5. **Immediately update:**
   - WordPress core
   - All plugins
   - All themes
6. **Change all passwords again**
7. **Install security plugin**

**Pros:** Fastest, most reliable
**Cons:** May lose recent content

### Option 2: Manual Cleanup (More Work)

**If no clean backup or need to preserve recent content:**

#### Phase 1: Scan Everything

**Use malware scanners:**
- Wordfence (free WordPress plugin)
- Sucuri SiteCheck (free online scan)
- MalCare (premium, thorough)
- Your host's malware scanner

**What to look for:**
- Modified core WordPress files
- Unknown PHP files
- Encoded/obfuscated code (lots of strange characters)
- New .htaccess files
- Hidden folders
- Files with recent modification dates

#### Phase 2: Clean Files

**Replace WordPress core:**
1. Download fresh WordPress from wordpress.org
2. Delete `/wp-admin/` and `/wp-includes/` folders
3. Upload fresh versions
4. Don't touch `/wp-content/` yet

**Clean wp-content:**
1. Delete `/wp-content/plugins/` entirely
2. Reinstall plugins fresh from WordPress.org
3. Delete unknown themes
4. Reinstall your theme fresh
5. Check `/wp-content/uploads/` for PHP files (shouldn't have any)

**Check these files specifically:**
- wp-config.php - Look for added code
- .htaccess - Look for strange redirects
- index.php - Should be minimal, standard
- Any PHP files in uploads folder (delete them)

#### Phase 3: Clean Database

**Look for:**
- Unknown admin users (delete them)
- Spam content in posts
- Malicious code in widget content
- Suspicious options in wp_options table

**Using phpMyAdmin:**
1. Check `wp_users` for unknown admins
2. Check `wp_options` for `siteurl` and `home` (correct URL?)
3. Search all tables for malicious domains
4. Look for base64_decode, eval, or strange code

### Option 3: Professional Cleanup

**Consider hiring help if:**
- Hack is complex
- You're not technical
- Business-critical site
- Multiple sites affected

**Services:**
- Sucuri ($199-499)
- Wordfence Care ($490/year includes cleanup)
- Your host's malware removal service
- Independent security consultants

## After Cleanup: Security Hardening

### Immediate Security Steps

1. **Update everything:**
   - WordPress core
   - All plugins
   - All themes
   - PHP version on server

2. **Install security plugin:**
   ```
   Recommended: Wordfence (free) or Sucuri
   ```

3. **Remove unused plugins/themes:**
   - Delete any you're not using
   - Hackers exploit abandoned code

4. **Check file permissions:**
   ```
   Folders: 755
   Files: 644
   wp-config.php: 600
   ```

5. **Add security headers** (via plugin or .htaccess)

### Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Enable 2FA** for all admin accounts

2. **Limit login attempts** (Wordfence does this)

3. **Regular backups:**
   - Daily if possible
   - Store off-site (not just on your server)

4. **Keep everything updated:**
   - Enable auto-updates for minor releases
   - Update manually for major releases

5. **Use strong passwords:**
   - Different password for each service
   - Use password manager

6. **Regular security scans:**
   - Weekly malware scans
   - Monitor file changes

## Understanding How Hacks Happen

### Most Common Entry Points

| Entry Point | Frequency | Prevention |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Outdated plugins | ~50% | Update regularly |
| Weak passwords | ~20% | Strong passwords + 2FA |
| Outdated WordPress | ~15% | Enable auto-updates |
| Outdated themes | ~10% | Update or remove |
| Server vulnerabilities | ~5% | Use quality hosting |

### Common Attack Types

**SEO Spam:**
- Hidden links injected
- Japanese/Chinese keyword spam
- Pharma spam

**Malware:**
- Redirects to malicious sites
- Cryptominers using your server
- Phishing pages

**Defacement:**
- Homepage replaced
- Political messages
- "Hacked by" notices

**Backdoors:**
- Hidden admin accounts
- Hidden PHP files for future access
- Modified core files

## Dealing with Google Warnings

### If Google Flagged Your Site

1. **Clean the site first** (don't request review while infected)

2. **Verify in Google Search Console** (search.google.com/search-console)

3. **Check Security Issues** section

4. **After cleanup, request review:**
   - Go to Security Issues
   - Click "Request a Review"
   - Explain what you cleaned
   - Wait 24-72 hours

### If You're in Google's Blocklist

More severe cases end up in Google's Safe Browsing blocklist.

1. Clean site thoroughly
2. Verify in Google Search Console
3. Request review through Security Issues
4. May take longer to resolve

## FAQ

### How did they get in?

Usually:
1. Outdated plugin with known vulnerability
2. Weak password (brute forced)
3. Shared hosting neighbor (cross-site contamination)

Check logs for login attempts and file changes.

### Will this happen again?

If you only clean without securing, yes. You must:
- Update everything
- Use strong passwords
- Install security plugin
- Keep backups

### Should I rebuild from scratch?

Consider it if:
- Can't find all infected files
- Hack keeps returning
- Site was already due for redesign

### Is my host at fault?

Sometimes. Poor shared hosting isolation can allow cross-site infection. But usually it's your responsibility to:
- Keep software updated
- Use strong passwords
- Secure your site

Consider better hosting if your host has frequent security issues.

### Can I sue the hackers?

Theoretically, but practically:
- Hackers are hard to identify
- Usually in foreign countries
- Rarely worth the legal cost

Focus on recovery and prevention.

### How long until everything's normal?

- Site functionality: Minutes to hours after cleanup
- Google warnings removed: 1-3 days after review
- SEO recovery: 2-4 weeks typically
- Reputation recovery: Varies

## Prevention Checklist

To prevent future hacks:

- [ ] Strong, unique passwords everywhere
- [ ] 2FA enabled on all admin accounts
- [ ] WordPress auto-updates enabled
- [ ] All plugins and themes current
- [ ] Unused plugins/themes deleted
- [ ] Security plugin installed and configured
- [ ] Regular backups (daily if possible)
- [ ] Quality hosting with good security
- [ ] Regular security scans scheduled
- [ ] File permissions properly set
- [ ] SSL certificate installed

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't panic** - Recovery is usually possible
2. **Backup first** - Before any cleanup attempts
3. **Change all passwords** immediately
4. **Restore from backup** if available and clean
5. **Manual cleanup** is thorough but time-consuming
6. **Professional help** is worth it for complex cases
7. **Prevent future hacks** by updating and securing

## What to Do Next

1. **Follow the recovery steps** above
2. **Implement security measures** before going live again
3. **Set up monitoring** for early detection
4. **Schedule regular updates and backups**
5. **Consider managed WordPress hosting** for better security

Frequent security issues might mean it's time for better hosting. Managed WordPress hosts like [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta), [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine), and [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) include security features and monitoring. Compare options with our [hosting comparison tool](/compare).
