Migrating your website to a new host feels risky. What if something breaks? What if you lose data? What if your site goes down?

Good news: website migration is straightforward when you follow the right steps. Thousands of sites migrate every day without issues.

This guide walks you through how to migrate your website safely, whether you're doing it yourself or using your host's free migration service.

## Before You Start: Pre-Migration Checklist

Don't skip this. Preparation prevents disasters.

### 1. Full Backup of Your Current Site

Create a complete backup including:

- [ ] All website files (wp-content folder for WordPress)
- [ ] Database (export via phpMyAdmin)
- [ ] Email accounts and messages (if applicable)
- [ ] SSL certificates (note expiration dates)
- [ ] Any custom configurations

Store backups in multiple locations (local computer + cloud storage).

### 2. Document Your Current Setup

Note these details from your current host:

| Information | Where to Find |
|-------------|---------------|
| PHP version | cPanel → PHP version |
| Database name | wp-config.php or cPanel |
| Server settings | .htaccess, php.ini |
| Cron jobs | cPanel → Cron Jobs |
| Email accounts | cPanel → Email Accounts |
| DNS records | cPanel → Zone Editor |

### 3. Check Your New Host's Requirements

Verify compatibility:

- PHP version supported
- Database type (MySQL/MariaDB version)
- Storage space needed
- Bandwidth requirements
- Any plugin/software restrictions

### 4. Choose Your Migration Timing

**Best times to migrate:**
- Low-traffic periods (check your analytics)
- Weekdays (easier to reach support)
- When you have several hours available

**Avoid:**
- Product launches
- Marketing campaigns
- Holidays/weekends (limited support)

## Option 1: Use Your New Host's Free Migration Service

## Option 3: Manual Migration (Full Control)

For non-WordPress sites or when you want complete control.

### Step 1: Download All Files

**Using cPanel File Manager:**
1. Log into old host cPanel
2. Go to File Manager → public_html
3. Select All → Compress
4. Download the zip file

**Using FTP:**
1. Connect with FileZilla or similar
2. Navigate to public_html
3. Download all files to your computer

### Step 2: Export Database

**Via phpMyAdmin:**
1. Log into cPanel → phpMyAdmin
2. Select your database
3. Click Export
4. Choose "Quick" method
5. Format: SQL
6. Click Go
7. Save the .sql file

### Step 3: Create Database on New Host

1. Log into new host cPanel
2. Go to MySQL Databases
3. Create new database (note the name)
4. Create new user with password
5. Add user to database with ALL PRIVILEGES

### Step 4: Upload Files to New Host

**Using cPanel File Manager:**
1. Upload your zip file to public_html
2. Extract the zip

**Using FTP:**
1. Connect to new host
2. Upload all files to public_html

### Step 5: Import Database

1. Log into new host cPanel → phpMyAdmin
2. Select your new database
3. Click Import
4. Choose your .sql file
5. Click Go

### Step 6: Update Configuration Files

For WordPress, edit `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('DB_NAME', 'new_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'new_database_user');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'new_database_password');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```

### Step 7: Test Before Switching DNS

Edit your local hosts file to preview the site on the new server:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

**On Windows:**
```
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

Add this line:
```
123.456.789.000 yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com
```

(Replace with your new server's IP address)

Now visiting yourdomain.com shows the new server. Test everything.

Remove the hosts file entry when done testing.

## Switching DNS: The Final Step

Once migration is complete and tested, point your domain to the new host.

### Option A: Update Nameservers (Recommended)

1. Log into your domain registrar (where you bought the domain)
2. Find DNS/Nameserver settings
3. Replace old nameservers with new host's nameservers

**Example nameservers:**
```
SiteGround:
ns1.siteground.net
ns2.siteground.net

Hostinger:
ns1.dns-parking.com
ns2.dns-parking.com

Cloudways:
Use A record instead
```

### Option B: Update A Record

If you want to keep nameservers at your registrar:

1. Log into domain registrar
2. Go to DNS settings
3. Find the A record for @ and www
4. Change IP address to new host's IP
5. Update or remove old A records

### DNS Propagation

DNS changes take time to spread globally:

| Timeframe | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| 0-2 hours | Some users see new site |
| 2-12 hours | Most users see new site |
| 12-48 hours | All users see new site |

**During propagation:**
- Some visitors see old site
- Some visitors see new site
- This is normal

**To minimize issues:**
- Keep old hosting active during propagation
- Don't make content changes on either site
- Lower TTL values before migration (if possible)

## Post-Migration Checklist

After DNS has propagated, verify everything:

## Common Migration Problems (And Solutions)

### Problem: White Screen of Death

**Causes:**
- PHP version mismatch
- Memory limit exceeded
- Plugin conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. Check PHP version matches old host
2. Increase memory limit in wp-config.php:
   ```php
   define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
   ```
3. Disable plugins via database if can't access admin

### Problem: Database Connection Error

**Causes:**
- Wrong database credentials in config
- Database not imported correctly
- Wrong database host

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check wp-config.php credentials
2. Verify database exists in phpMyAdmin
3. Confirm database user has permissions
4. Try 'localhost' vs '127.0.0.1' for DB_HOST

### Problem: Broken Images/Links

**Causes:**
- Hardcoded URLs to old domain
- Files didn't transfer completely
- Permission issues

**Solutions:**
1. Run search-replace on database (Better Search Replace plugin)
2. Re-upload missing files
3. Check file permissions (755 for folders, 644 for files)

### Problem: SSL Not Working

**Causes:**
- SSL not installed on new host
- Mixed content (http resources on https page)

**Solutions:**
1. Install SSL via cPanel → SSL/TLS or Let's Encrypt
2. Use "Really Simple SSL" plugin temporarily
3. Run search-replace: http:// → https://

### Problem: Email Not Working

**Causes:**
- MX records not updated
- Email accounts not recreated
- SPF/DKIM records missing

**Solutions:**
1. Update MX records to new host
2. Recreate email accounts
3. Add SPF and DKIM records for deliverability

### Problem: Site Slow After Migration

**Causes:**
- Caching not configured
- Server location changed
- New host has different specs

**Solutions:**
1. Set up caching (LiteSpeed Cache, W3 Total Cache)
2. Configure CDN (Cloudflare is free)
3. Optimize images and database

## When to Cancel Old Hosting

**Don't cancel immediately.** Wait until:

- [ ] DNS fully propagated (48+ hours)
- [ ] All functionality verified
- [ ] Email working on new host
- [ ] At least one successful backup on new host
- [ ] You've accessed the new site from multiple devices/locations

**Before canceling:**
- Download one final backup from old host
- Export any email you want to keep
- Save any configuration notes
- Check refund policy (you might get partial refund)

For most people, using your new host's free migration is the best choice.

## FAQ

### How long does website migration take?

The actual migration takes 1-4 hours. DNS propagation adds 24-48 hours. Plan for your site to be fully migrated within 72 hours total.

### Will my site go down during migration?

Not if done correctly. By keeping both hosts active and only switching DNS after the new site is ready, downtime is zero or minimal (seconds during DNS switch).

### Do I lose SEO rankings when migrating?

No, if done properly. Keep the same URLs, implement 301 redirects if URLs change, and update Google Search Console. Some minor fluctuation is normal but recovers quickly.

### Can I migrate to a different CMS during migration?

That's a redesign, not just migration. Moving WordPress to WordPress is straightforward. Changing platforms (WordPress to Shopify, etc.) is a larger project requiring content recreation.

### What if something goes wrong?

This is why backups matter. With a full backup, you can restore your site to the old host while troubleshooting the new one.

### Should I migrate or start fresh?

Migrate if you want to keep your content, SEO, and history. Start fresh only if you're completely rebuilding the site anyway.

### My host says migration will take a week. Is that normal?

For free migration services, 3-5 business days is common due to queue volume. If you need it faster, ask about priority/rush options or do it yourself.
