You signed up for hosting at $2.99/month. Great deal, right?

Then renewal time comes: $14.99/month. That's a 5x price increase.

This isn't a mistake. It's how the hosting industry works. Here's what's happening and how to pay less.

## The Intro Pricing Model

### How It Works

1. **Sign up:** $2.99/month for 36 months (paid upfront: $107.64)
2. **Renewal:** $14.99/month (~$180/year)
3. **Ongoing:** You pay the higher rate forever

The intro price is a customer acquisition cost. Hosts lose money or break even on your first term to win your business.

### Why Hosts Do This

**Customer acquisition costs are high:**
- Marketing and advertising
- Affiliate commissions ($50-150 per signup)
- Support for new users
- Infrastructure for new accounts

Hosts recoup these costs over time at the higher renewal rate.

**Switching costs keep you:**
- Migration effort
- Downtime risk
- DNS changes
- Email disruption

Most people stay and pay the renewal rate rather than switch.

### Real Price Comparisons

| Host | Intro Price | Renewal Price | Increase |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) Premium | $2.99/mo | $7.99/mo | 2.7x |
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) StartUp | $2.99/mo | $17.99/mo | 6x |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) Basic | $2.95/mo | $11.99/mo | 4x |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) Startup | $2.99/mo | $12.99/mo | 4.3x |
| [GoDaddy](/hosting/godaddy) Economy | $2.99/mo | $8.99/mo | 3x |
| [HostGator](/hosting/hostgator) Hatchling | $2.75/mo | $11.95/mo | 4.3x |

## True Cost Calculation

### 3-Year Total Cost Comparison

Looking at total cost over 3 years (36 months) reveals the real picture:

| Host | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) Premium | $36 | $96 | $96 | $228 |
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) StartUp | $36 | $216 | $216 | $468 |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) Basic | $35 | $144 | $144 | $323 |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) Startup | $36 | $156 | $156 | $348 |

**Key insight:** The lowest intro price doesn't always mean the lowest total cost.

### Hosts Without Intro Pricing

Some hosts charge the same price at signup and renewal:

| Host | Monthly Price | 3-Year Total |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) (DO 1GB) | $14/mo | $504 |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) Starter | $35/mo | $1,260 |
| [DigitalOcean](/hosting/digitalocean) Basic | $5/mo | $180 |

No surprise at renewal. What you see is what you pay.

## Strategies to Pay Less

### Strategy 1: Lock In Multi-Year Rates

If you like your host, pay upfront for the longest term:

**Example with SiteGround:**
- Monthly: Not available
- 12 months: $2.99/mo intro
- 24 months: $2.99/mo intro
- 36 months: $2.99/mo intro

**Best approach:** 36-month term if you're confident about the host. You lock in the intro rate for 3 years.

### Strategy 2: Switch Hosts at Renewal

The most aggressive savings approach:

1. Sign up with Host A at intro rate
2. At renewal, migrate to Host B at their intro rate
3. Repeat as needed

**Downsides:**
- Migration effort
- Potential downtime
- Learning new platform

**Upsides:**
- Always pay intro prices
- Experience different hosts
- Leverage best current deals

### Strategy 3: Ask for Renewal Discounts

Before renewal, contact support and ask for a discount.

**What to say:**
"I'm considering migrating to [competitor] because their prices are lower. Is there any discount available on my renewal?"

**Typical results:**
- 20-40% off renewal rate
- Extended intro pricing for another year
- Free months added

Not guaranteed, but often works. Retention is cheaper than acquisition.

### Strategy 4: Choose Hosts with Lower Renewal Rates

Prioritize hosts where the renewal rate is reasonable:

| Host | Renewal Rate | Verdict |
|------|--------------|---------|
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | $7.99/mo | Reasonable |
| [Namecheap](/hosting/namecheap) | $4.88/mo | Very reasonable |
| [DreamHost](/hosting/dreamhost) | $5.99/mo | Reasonable |
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | $17.99/mo | High |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | $11.99/mo | Moderate |

### Strategy 5: Use Hosts Without Intro Pricing

Flat-rate hosts offer predictability:

**[Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways):** Pay monthly, same price always. Start at $14/mo.

**[DigitalOcean](/hosting/digitalocean):** VPS pricing, no tricks. Start at $5/mo.

**[Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta):** Premium pricing but no surprises. Start at $35/mo.

You pay more initially but never face a surprise renewal increase.

## The Math of Switching vs Staying

### Scenario: SiteGround Renewal

After 3 years at intro rate:
- **Stay and renew:** $17.99/mo × 12 = $216/year
- **Switch to Hostinger intro:** $36/year

**Savings from switching:** $180/year

### When Switching Makes Sense

**Switch if:**
- Renewal rate is 3x+ intro rate
- You're comfortable with migration
- New host offers features you need
- Support has been disappointing

**Stay if:**
- Renewal rate is reasonable
- You're happy with performance
- Migration seems risky
- Time is more valuable than savings

### Migration Cost Calculation

Factor in your time:

| Task | Time | Your Hourly Rate | Cost |
|------|------|------------------|------|
| Research new host | 1-2 hours | $30 | $30-60 |
| Migration | 2-4 hours | $30 | $60-120 |
| Testing | 1 hour | $30 | $30 |
| Troubleshooting | 0-2 hours | $30 | $0-60 |
| **Total** | 4-9 hours | | $120-270 |

If you're saving $180/year and migration costs $150 in time, it's still worth it. If you're saving $50/year, maybe not.

## Hidden Fees Beyond Renewal

### Domain Renewal

Many hosts include a "free" first-year domain, then charge at renewal:

| Host | First Year | Renewal |
|------|------------|---------|
| Bluehost | Free | $21.99/year |
| HostGator | Free | $17.99/year |
| GoDaddy | Discounted | $19.99/year |

**Alternative:** Register domains separately at Cloudflare ($9-10/year) or Namecheap (~$12/year).

### SSL Certificates

Most hosts now include free Let's Encrypt SSL. But some still charge:

| Host | SSL Cost |
|------|----------|
| Most hosts | Free (Let's Encrypt) |
| GoDaddy (some plans) | $80-300/year |

**Red flag:** If a host charges for basic SSL, consider it a warning sign.

### Backup Add-ons

Some hosts include backups; others charge:

| Host | Backup Status |
|------|---------------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | Daily backups included |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Daily included, hourly add-on |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | CodeGuard add-on ($3/mo) |

### "Premium" Support

Some hosts restrict support on basic plans:

- Phone support: Premium only
- Faster response: Priority add-on
- WordPress help: Upgrade required

## Renewal Price by Host Category

| Host | Intro | Renewal | Increase |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | $2.99 | $7.99 | 2.7x |
| [Namecheap](/hosting/namecheap) | $1.88 | $4.88 | 2.6x |
| [DreamHost](/hosting/dreamhost) | $2.59 | $5.99 | 2.3x |

| Host | Intro | Renewal | Increase |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | $2.99 | $17.99 | 6x |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) | $2.99 | $12.99 | 4.3x |
| [GreenGeeks](/hosting/greengeeks) | $2.95 | $11.95 | 4x |

### Managed/Premium Hosts (No Intro Pricing)

| [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) | $14/mo | $14/mo | 1x |
| [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) | $20/mo | $20/mo | 1x |

## FAQ

### Why don't hosts just charge fair prices upfront?

Competition. If Host A charges $3/mo intro and Host B charges $10/mo (but same renewal rate), most people choose Host A. The market punishes transparent pricing.

### Is the intro pricing predatory?

It's aggressive marketing but legal and standard industry practice. The renewal rate is disclosed (often in small print). It's on consumers to calculate total cost.

### Can I negotiate renewal rates?

Often yes. Contact support before renewal. Say you're considering switching. Many hosts offer 20-50% renewal discounts to retain customers.

### Should I always switch at renewal?

Not necessarily. If you're happy with performance and support, the convenience of staying may be worth the higher rate. But if you're unhappy or the increase is extreme, switching makes sense.

### Do all hosts have intro pricing?

No. Cloud/VPS hosts (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Cloudways) and premium managed hosts (Kinsta, WP Engine) typically charge the same price at signup and renewal.

### Is the first-year "free" domain really free?

Sort of. You don't pay year 1, but you pay the (often inflated) renewal rate from year 2. And domain transfers have a mandatory extension period. Calculate total domain cost over your expected hosting duration.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Intro prices are customer acquisition costs**, not the real price
2. **Calculate 3-year total cost**, not just monthly price
3. **Lower renewal rates exist**—Hostinger, Namecheap, DreamHost
4. **Flat-rate hosts eliminate surprises**—Cloudways, Kinsta, DigitalOcean
5. **Switching saves money** if you're willing to migrate
6. **Negotiate before renewal**—hosts often offer discounts
7. **Watch for hidden fees**—domains, SSL, backups, support

## What to Do Next

1. **Check your renewal date** and rate
2. **Calculate total cost** for your hosting term
3. **Compare with alternatives** using true costs
4. **Decide:** Negotiate, switch, or accept
5. **Plan ahead** for next renewal
