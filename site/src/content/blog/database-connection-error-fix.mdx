"Error establishing a database connection" is one of the most common and frustrating WordPress errors. Your site is completely down, and you need to fix it fast.

Here's what causes this error and how to fix it, step by step.

## What This Error Means

WordPress stores all your content (posts, pages, settings, users) in a MySQL database. When WordPress can't connect to that database, you see this error.

**The database connection requires:**
1. Correct database name
2. Correct database username
3. Correct database password
4. Database server running
5. Enough server resources

If any of these fail, you get the error.

## Quick Diagnosis

### Check if Database Server is Down

**Test 1: Can you access phpMyAdmin?**
1. Log into hosting control panel (cPanel)
2. Click phpMyAdmin
3. If it loads, database server is running

**Test 2: Check admin vs frontend**
- If `yoursite.com/wp-admin/` shows different error mentioning "repair," database may be corrupted
- If both show same error, likely credentials or server issue

## Common Causes & Fixes

### Cause 1: Wrong Database Credentials

**Most common cause.** The wp-config.php file has incorrect database settings.

**How it happens:**
- Password was changed
- Database was moved
- Typo in credentials
- Migration issues

**Fix:**

1. **Access your files** via FTP/SFTP or File Manager

2. **Open wp-config.php** in root directory

3. **Find these lines:**
```php
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_password');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```

4. **Verify credentials in cPanel:**
   - Go to MySQL Databases
   - Check database name matches DB_NAME
   - Check username matches DB_USER
   - Note: Password isn't shown, may need to reset

5. **Reset password if unsure:**
   - In cPanel → MySQL Databases
   - Find the user → Change Password
   - Update wp-config.php with new password

6. **Save and test**

### Cause 2: Database Server is Down

Your hosting's MySQL server is temporarily offline.

**Symptoms:**
- Error appeared suddenly
- No changes were made
- Multiple sites affected (if you have several)

**Fix:**

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Often resolves itself
2. **Check host's status page** for outages
3. **Contact host support** if persists
4. **Check resource limits** - May be suspended for overuse

### Cause 3: Corrupted Database

Database tables can become corrupted, especially after crashes or resource limits.

**Symptoms:**
- wp-admin shows: "One or more database tables are unavailable. The database may need to be repaired."

**Fix Option 1: WordPress Repair**

1. Add to wp-config.php (before "That's all, stop editing!"):
```php
define('WP_ALLOW_REPAIR', true);
```

2. Visit: `yoursite.com/wp-admin/maint/repair.php`

3. Click "Repair Database" or "Repair and Optimize"

4. **Remove the line from wp-config.php** when done (security risk if left)

**Fix Option 2: phpMyAdmin Repair**

1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select your WordPress database
3. Select all tables (check boxes)
4. Choose "Repair table" from dropdown
5. Execute

### Cause 4: Exceeded Database Connections

Too many simultaneous connections to database.

**Symptoms:**
- Error comes and goes
- Happens during traffic spikes
- May see "Too many connections" in logs

**Causes:**
- Traffic spike
- Poorly coded plugin
- Bot attack

**Fixes:**

1. **Wait for traffic to subside**

2. **Increase max connections** (if you have access):
```
max_connections = 500
```

3. **Optimize slow queries:**
   - Install Query Monitor plugin
   - Identify slow database queries
   - Fix or remove problematic plugins

4. **Upgrade hosting** if consistently hitting limits

### Cause 5: Database Host Wrong

The DB_HOST value in wp-config.php is incorrect.

**Common values:**
- `localhost` - Most shared hosting
- `127.0.0.1` - Same as localhost
- `mysql.yourdomain.com` - Some hosts
- Specific IP or hostname - Cloud/VPS setups

**Fix:**
1. Check your host's documentation
2. Contact support for correct value
3. Common hosts:
   - Most shared: `localhost`
   - GoDaddy: Often specific hostname
   - SiteGround: `localhost`
   - Bluehost: `localhost`

### Cause 6: Insufficient Server Resources

Your hosting plan ran out of memory, CPU, or disk space.

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple issues, not just database
- Error in server logs about resources
- Host sends warning emails

**Fixes:**

1. **Check disk space:**
   - cPanel → Disk Usage
   - Clear old backups, logs, unused files

2. **Check resource usage:**
   - cPanel → Resource Usage
   - Identify spikes or overuse

3. **Upgrade plan** if consistently maxed out

4. **Optimize site:**
   - Remove unused plugins
   - Optimize images
   - Add caching

### Cause 7: Plugin or Theme Conflict

A recent plugin/theme update corrupted database or causes excessive queries.

**Symptoms:**
- Error started after update
- Error after activating plugin

**Fix:**

1. **Access files via FTP**

2. **Rename plugins folder:**
```
/wp-content/plugins/ → /wp-content/plugins_disabled/
```

3. **Check if site loads**

4. **If yes, rename back to plugins/**

5. **Rename plugins one by one** to find culprit:
```
/wp-content/plugins/problem-plugin/ → /wp-content/plugins/problem-plugin_disabled/
```

6. **Delete or replace problematic plugin**

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check MySQL Error Logs

**In cPanel:**
1. Go to Errors in cPanel
2. Check for MySQL-related errors

**Via SSH:**
```bash
tail -100 /var/log/mysql/error.log
```

### Test Database Connection Manually

Create a test file `test-db.php` in your root:

```php
<?php
$link = mysqli_connect('localhost', 'your_user', 'your_password', 'your_database');

if (!$link) {
    die('Connection failed: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
}

echo 'Connected successfully';
mysqli_close($link);
?>
```

Visit `yoursite.com/test-db.php` - delete after testing!

### Check if Database Exists

1. Log into phpMyAdmin
2. Look for your database name in left sidebar
3. If missing, database may have been deleted
4. Restore from backup

## Prevention

### Regular Backups

Use backup plugins or host backups:
- UpdraftPlus (free)
- Host's backup feature
- BlogVault (premium)

### Monitor Database Health

- Use WP-Optimize plugin for maintenance
- Schedule regular database optimization
- Keep plugins updated

### Use Quality Hosting

Reliable hosts have:
- Better MySQL configurations
- More stable servers
- Proactive monitoring

Consider: [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground), [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta), [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways)

## FAQ

### Why did this happen suddenly?

Common sudden causes:
- Host server issue
- Resource limit hit
- Automatic password rotation (rare)
- Database corruption from crash

### Can I lose my content?

If the database is deleted or severely corrupted, yes. This is why backups are critical. In most cases, the data is fine—it's just a connection issue.

### Should I contact my host?

Yes, if:
- You've checked credentials and they're correct
- phpMyAdmin doesn't work either
- Error persists after basic troubleshooting

### How do I prevent this?

1. Use reliable hosting
2. Keep regular backups
3. Update WordPress/plugins regularly
4. Don't over-install plugins
5. Monitor server resources

### The error says my database needs repair. Is that serious?

Usually fixable with the repair function. If repair fails, restore from backup.
