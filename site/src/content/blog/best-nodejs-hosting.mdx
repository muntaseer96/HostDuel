Node.js applications need hosting that supports server-side JavaScript, handles concurrent connections well, and ideally makes deployment easy.

Here are the best hosting options for Node.js in 2026, from simple PaaS to full VPS control.

## Node.js Hosting Options

**Cons:**
- More management required
- Security is your responsibility
- Need Linux/Node.js knowledge

**Best for:** Experienced developers, production applications, cost-conscious teams

### Serverless / Edge

**What it is:** Functions that run on-demand without managing servers.

**Pros:**
- Pay per execution
- Automatic scaling
- No server management
- Global edge deployment

**Cons:**

## Deployment Methods

### PaaS Deployment (Render/Railway/Vercel)

**Typical workflow:**
1. Connect GitHub/GitLab repository
2. Platform detects Node.js
3. Configure environment variables
4. Push to deploy

**Example package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "npm run compile"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "20.x"
  }
}
```

### VPS Deployment (DigitalOcean/Vultr)

**Typical workflow:**
1. Create server (Droplet)
2. SSH into server
3. Install Node.js (nvm recommended)
4. Clone your repository
5. Install dependencies
6. Set up process manager (PM2)
7. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx)
8. Set up SSL (Let's Encrypt)

**Key tools:**
- PM2: Keep Node running
- Nginx: Reverse proxy, SSL termination
- Certbot: SSL certificates

### Docker Deployment

**Typical workflow:**
1. Create Dockerfile
2. Build image
3. Push to registry
4. Deploy to platform

**Example Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## What to Look For

### For Production Apps

1. **Uptime guarantees** - 99.9%+
2. **Scaling options** - Horizontal and vertical
3. **Database proximity** - Same region
4. **Logging/monitoring** - Built-in or easy integration
5. **CI/CD integration** - Automatic deployments

### For Side Projects

1. **Free tier availability**
2. **Easy deployment** - Git push to deploy
3. **Simple pricing** - Predictable costs
4. **Good documentation**

### For Enterprise

2. **SLA guarantees**
3. **Support quality**
4. **Team features**
5. **Private networking**

## FAQ

### Can I use shared hosting for Node.js?

Generally no. Traditional shared hosts (Bluehost, HostGator) run PHP/Apache and don't support Node.js. You need:
- PaaS (Render, Railway)
- VPS
- Specialized Node hosting

### What about Heroku?

Heroku eliminated free tier. Still works but expensive for small projects. Consider Render or Railway as alternatives.

### How do I keep my Node app running?

**On PaaS:** Handled automatically

**On VPS:** Use PM2
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js
pm2 startup  # Auto-start on reboot
pm2 save
```

### What Node.js version should I use?

**Production:** LTS version (currently 20.x)
**Specify in package.json:**
```json
"engines": {
  "node": "20.x"
}
```

### How do I handle environment variables?

**PaaS:** Dashboard or CLI to set variables
**VPS:** `.env` file with dotenv, or system environment

**Never commit secrets to Git!**

### WebSockets support?

| Platform | WebSocket Support |
|----------|------------------|
| Render | Yes |
| Railway | Yes |
| Fly.io | Yes |
| Vercel | Limited (Edge Functions) |
| VPS | Yes (with configuration) |

### Is Vercel only for Next.js?

No, Vercel supports any Node.js framework, but it's optimized for Next.js. Other frameworks work but may not use all features.

## Recommended Setups

### Simple Express API

**Best:** Render (Free → $7/mo)
- Easy deployment
- Free SSL

- Easy to upgrade later

## Key Takeaways

1. **PaaS is easiest** for most Node.js deployments
2. **VPS gives more control** but requires more work
3. **Vercel excels for Next.js** specifically
