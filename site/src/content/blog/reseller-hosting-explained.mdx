Reseller hosting lets you buy hosting wholesale and sell it to your own customers under your brand. It's a way to start a hosting business without building infrastructure.

Here's how reseller hosting works and whether it's right for you.

## What Is Reseller Hosting?

**The model:**
1. You buy a reseller plan from a hosting provider
2. You get allocated resources (disk, bandwidth)
3. You create individual hosting accounts for clients
4. Clients see your brand, not the parent host
5. You handle billing and first-line support

**What you get:**
- WHM (Web Host Manager) control panel
- Ability to create cPanel accounts
- White-label branding options
- Allocated resources to distribute

## Who Should Consider Reseller Hosting?

### Good Fit

✅ Web designers/developers with clients needing hosting
✅ Marketing agencies managing client sites
✅ IT consultants wanting to offer hosting
✅ Entrepreneurs starting hosting businesses

### Not a Good Fit

❌ Just need hosting for one site
❌ Don't want to handle support
❌ No technical knowledge
❌ No existing client base

## How the Business Model Works

### Revenue Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Reseller plan cost | $30/month |
| You charge per client | $15/month |
| Break-even | 2 clients |
| With 10 clients | $150/month revenue |
| Profit (10 clients) | $120/month |

### Typical Margins

- **Low-touch:** 50-100% markup
- **Managed services:** 200-400% markup
- **Premium/white-glove:** 500%+ markup

## Starting a Reseller Business

### Step 1: Choose Your Niche

- Agency hosting for clients
- Industry-specific (real estate, restaurants)
- Regional focus

### Step 2: Set Up Infrastructure

1. Purchase reseller plan
2. Configure white-label nameservers
3. Set up billing (WHMCS, Blesta)
4. Create packages/pricing

### Step 3: Define Your Services

| Service Level | What's Included | Typical Price |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Basic | Hosting only | $10-15/month |
| Managed | + Updates, backups | $30-50/month |
| Premium | + Support, optimization | $75-150/month |

### Step 4: Handle Support

**Options:**
- Handle yourself (most common starting out)
- Outsource to support companies
- Escalate to parent host for server issues

## FAQ

### Is reseller hosting profitable?

Can be, but margins are tight on hosting alone. Most successful resellers bundle with web design, maintenance, or marketing services.

### Do I need technical knowledge?

Basic cPanel/WHM knowledge needed. You don't need to be a sysadmin, but should understand hosting basics.

### What if a client's site gets hacked?

You handle first-line support. Server-level issues escalate to parent host. Consider including security services.

### Can clients tell it's resold?

With proper white-labeling (custom nameservers, branded cPanel), no. Without it, they might see the parent host's branding.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Reseller hosting = wholesale hosting** you rebrand and resell
2. **Best for agencies** already serving clients
3. **Margins are modest** - bundle with other services
4. **WHM/cPanel** is standard for management
5. **You handle support** for your clients

## What to Do Next

1. **Assess your client base** - Do you have clients needing hosting?
2. **Choose a reseller host** based on your needs
3. **Set up billing system** (WHMCS recommended)
4. **Define your packages** and pricing
5. **Start with existing clients** before marketing
