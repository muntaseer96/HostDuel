Static site hosting has never been better. Free tiers are generous, deployment is automated, and performance is excellent.

But which platform should you choose? Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare Pages all have strengths and weaknesses.

Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Netlify | Vercel | GitHub Pages | Cloudflare Pages |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Best for** | General static/JAMstack | Next.js/React | Docs, simple sites | All static sites |
| **Free tier** | Generous | Generous | Good | Very generous |
| **Serverless functions** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Build minutes** | 300/month | 6000/month | N/A | Unlimited |
| **Bandwidth** | 100GB | 100GB | 100GB | Unlimited |
| **Custom domains** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **SSL** | Free | Free | Free | Free |

## Netlify

### Overview

Netlify pioneered modern JAMstack hosting. It's feature-rich and developer-friendly.

### Free Tier Includes

- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 300 build minutes/month
- 1 concurrent build
- Serverless functions (125K requests/month)
- Form handling (100 submissions/month)
- Identity (1000 users/month)
- Analytics (limited)

### Strengths

**Deploy previews:** Every PR gets a unique preview URL. Share with team, stakeholders, or QA.

**Forms handling:** Add `netlify` attribute to forms—no backend needed.

**Split testing:** A/B test different branches.

**Plugins ecosystem:** Extend builds with community plugins.

**Edge functions:** Run code at the edge for personalization.

### Weaknesses

**Build minute limits:** 300/month on free tier depletes quickly with frequent deploys.

**Function limitations:** 10-second timeout on free tier.

**Pricing scales quickly:** Pro tier is $19/member/month.

### Best For

- JAMstack sites of all kinds
- Teams wanting deploy previews
- Sites needing form handling
- Non-Next.js frameworks (Hugo, 11ty, Gatsby)

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Build Minutes | Bandwidth |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Starter | Free | 300/mo | 100GB |
| Pro | $19/user/mo | 25,000/mo | 1TB |
| Business | $99/user/mo | 25,000/mo | 1TB |

## Vercel

### Overview

Vercel created Next.js and optimizes specifically for it, though it works with any framework.

### Free Tier Includes

- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 6000 build minutes/month (20x Netlify!)
- Serverless functions (100GB-hours)
- Edge functions
- Analytics (basic)
- Preview deployments

### Strengths

**Next.js optimization:** If you use Next.js, Vercel is the best deployment target. Features like ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) work seamlessly.

**Generous build minutes:** 6000/month vs Netlify's 300.

**Fast deployments:** Excellent global edge network.

**Framework autodetection:** Detects and configures most frameworks automatically.

### Weaknesses

**Hobby tier restrictions:** Free tier is for personal, non-commercial projects only. Commercial use requires Pro ($20/month minimum).

**Next.js bias:** Non-Next.js frameworks work but aren't as optimized.

**Function size limits:** Serverless functions have stricter size limits.

### Best For

- Next.js projects (clearly)
- React developers
- Personal projects and portfolios
- Rapid iteration (generous build minutes)

### Pricing

| Plan | Price | Build Minutes | Note |
|------|-------|---------------|------|
| Hobby | Free | 6000/mo | Personal only |
| Pro | $20/user/mo | 24,000/mo | Commercial OK |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | |

**Important:** Hobby tier prohibits commercial use. If your portfolio helps you get clients, that's arguably commercial.

## GitHub Pages

### Overview

Free hosting directly from GitHub repositories. Simple but limited.

### Free Tier Includes

- 100GB bandwidth/month
- 1GB repository size
- 10 builds per hour
- Jekyll support (auto-built)

## Migration Considerations

### From Traditional Hosting to Static

**Process:**
1. Choose static site generator (or build tool)
2. Convert or recreate site
3. Connect Git repository
4. Configure build settings
5. Point domain

### Between Static Platforms

**Usually simple:**
1. Connect same repository to new platform
2. Configure build command and output directory
3. Test deploy preview
4. Move custom domain

Most sites migrate in under an hour.

## FAQ

### Which is fastest?

All are fast. Cloudflare has the largest edge network (300+ locations). For practical purposes, visitors won't notice differences.

### Can I use these for WordPress?

Not directly. These host static files. You could:
- Use WordPress headlessly with a static frontend
- Export WordPress to static HTML
- Use alternatives like Hugo or 11ty

### Do I need a static site generator?

No. You can deploy plain HTML/CSS/JS files. But static site generators (Hugo, 11ty, Astro) make content management easier.

### What happens if I exceed free tier limits?

- **Netlify:** Builds stop until next month, site stays up
- **Vercel:** May throttle or ask to upgrade
- **GitHub Pages:** Site may become unavailable
- **Cloudflare:** Unlimited bandwidth, unlikely to exceed

### Can I use server-side rendering?

Vercel and Netlify support SSR for frameworks like Next.js. GitHub Pages and basic Cloudflare Pages don't. Cloudflare Workers can add SSR capabilities.

### Which is best for beginners?

**GitHub Pages** is simplest for basic sites.
**Netlify** is most beginner-friendly for JAMstack.

## Summary Recommendations

| Use Case | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Next.js projects | Vercel |
| General JAMstack | Netlify |
| Documentation sites | GitHub Pages |
| High-traffic / cost-conscious | Cloudflare Pages |
