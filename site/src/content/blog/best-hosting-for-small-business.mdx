Your small business website needs hosting that's reliable, professional, and won't break the bank.

This guide helps you find the best hosting for your small business based on your specific situation.

## Common Small Business Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Choosing the Cheapest Option

**The problem:** $0.99/mo hosting means slow sites, poor support, and frequent downtime.

**The solution:** Budget hosts like [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) offer genuine value. Don't go cheaper.

### Mistake 2: Over-buying Resources

**The problem:** Paying for enterprise features you'll never use.

**The solution:** Start with basic shared hosting. Upgrade only when you hit limits.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Email Hosting

**The problem:** Using gmail.com or yahoo.com for business looks unprofessional.

**The solution:** Ensure your plan includes email, or budget for Google Workspace (~$6/user/mo).

### Mistake 4: No Backup Strategy

**The problem:** One hack or mistake destroys your site.

**The solution:** Choose hosting with automatic backups. Keep your own backups too.

### Mistake 5: Signing Up for 36 Months

**The problem:** Locked in if you hate the host or your business changes.

**The solution:** Start with 12 months. Commit longer only after you're satisfied.

## Setting Up Business Email

Professional email (you@yourbusiness.com) matters for credibility.

### Option 1: Hosting-Included Email

Many hosts include email:
- [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) - Unlimited email accounts
- [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) - Email included on most plans
- [Namecheap](/hosting/namecheap) - Email included

**Pros:** Simple, included in hosting cost
**Cons:** Basic features, webmail interface

### Option 2: Google Workspace

$6/user/month for Gmail with your domain, plus Google Docs, Drive, etc.

**Pros:** Professional, familiar interface, collaboration tools
**Cons:** Additional cost

### Option 3: Microsoft 365

$6/user/month for Outlook with your domain, plus Office apps.

**Pros:** Familiar for Office users, desktop apps included
**Cons:** Additional cost

### Recommendation

For 1-2 person businesses, hosting-included email works fine. For teams or if you need collaboration tools, Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 is worth the cost.

## Cost Comparison: First Year vs Ongoing

Understanding true costs helps you budget properly:

| Host | Year 1 | Year 2+ | 3-Year Total |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) Premium | $36 | $96 | $228 |
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) StartUp | $36 | $216 | $468 |
| [Namecheap](/hosting/namecheap) Stellar | $23 | $58 | $139 |
| [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) DO | $168 | $168 | $504 |

**Note:** Cloudways has no renewal increase—same price always.

Factor in:
- Domain (~$12/year)
- SSL (usually free)
- Email (free or $72/user/year for Google Workspace)
- Backups (included or ~$24/year add-on)

## FAQ

### How much should a small business pay for hosting?

$3-15/month is reasonable for most small businesses. Under $3/month often means poor quality. Over $15/month is usually overkill unless you have high traffic or specific needs.

### Do I need a dedicated server for my business?

Almost certainly not. Shared hosting or cloud hosting handles 95%+ of small business needs. Consider dedicated servers only with 500K+ monthly visitors or specific compliance requirements.

### Should I get managed WordPress hosting for my business site?

If your site is WordPress and budget allows, managed hosting ([Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta), [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine)) provides better security and performance. But quality shared hosting ([SiteGround](/hosting/siteground)) works well for most small business WordPress sites.

### What's the best hosting for a business just starting out?

[Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) Premium or [Namecheap](/hosting/namecheap) Stellar. Affordable, reliable, includes what you need. Upgrade later when your business grows.

### Can I host my business website for free?

Technically yes (WordPress.com free tier, Wix free tier), but it looks unprofessional. You'll have their branding, a subdomain (yourbusiness.wixsite.com), and limited features. For business, pay for proper hosting.

### What happens if my business website gets hacked?

With good hosting, you restore from backup and the host helps identify the vulnerability. Choose hosting with automatic backups and basic security features. Consider adding Cloudflare (free) for additional protection.

## Next Steps

1. **Assess your needs:** Traffic expectations, budget, technical comfort level
2. **Start with value:** [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) or [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) for most small businesses
3. **Get professional email:** Included with hosting or Google Workspace
4. **Set up backups:** Use hosting backups plus your own (UpdraftPlus for WordPress)
5. **Plan for growth:** Know when and how you'll upgrade
