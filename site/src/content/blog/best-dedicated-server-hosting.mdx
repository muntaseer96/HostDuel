Dedicated servers give you an entire physical server for your exclusive use. No sharing resources, no noisy neighbors—just raw power for demanding applications.

Here's when you need dedicated hosting and which providers offer the best servers.

## When You Need Dedicated Hosting

### Signs You've Outgrown VPS

- VPS at maximum resources still insufficient

|----------|---------------|
| High-traffic sites | Consistent performance |
| Game servers | Low latency, high CPU |
