Managing multiple client websites requires hosting that scales, provides easy management tools, and ideally lets you white-label the service as your own.

Here's how to choose hosting for your agency and which providers work best for managing client sites.

## What Agencies Need from Hosting

### Multi-Site Management

Managing 10, 50, or 100+ sites requires:

- **Centralized dashboard:** See all sites in one place
- **Bulk operations:** Update plugins, themes across sites
- **Individual access:** Give clients access to their site only
- **Site staging:** Test changes before going live

### White-Label Options

Present hosting as your own service:

- **Custom branding:** Your logo on client dashboards
- **Custom nameservers:** ns1.youragency.com
- **Branded emails:** support@youragency.com
- **Hide provider identity:** Clients see your brand only

### Scalable Pricing

Agency-friendly pricing models:

- **Per-site pricing:** Pay for what you use
- **Bulk discounts:** Lower cost per site at volume
- **Reseller margins:** Mark up and profit
- **No per-seat charges:** Add team members free

### Reliability

Your reputation depends on uptime:

- **99.9%+ uptime:** Minimum acceptable
- **Proactive monitoring:** Catch issues early
- **Fast support:** Resolve problems quickly
- **Automatic backups:** Recover from disasters

## FAQ

### How many sites can I host on one plan?

**Shared hosting (SiteGround GrowBig):** "Unlimited" but realistically 20-30 small sites

**Managed WordPress (Kinsta):** Based on plan (5, 10, 25+ sites)

**Cloud (Cloudways):** Depends on server size, unlimited theoretically

**Reseller:** Based on disk/bandwidth allocation

### Should I use reseller hosting or managed hosting?

**Use reseller if:**
- You want full white-label
- You're comfortable with cPanel/WHM
- You want to resell hosting as a product
- You have technical staff

**Use managed if:**
- You want the host to handle technical
- Client satisfaction is priority
- You don't want to be "the hosting company"
- WordPress sites primarily

### Can clients access their own site?

**Yes, on most platforms:**
- Cloudways: Team member access per application
- Kinsta: User roles per site
- cPanel/reseller: Individual cPanel accounts
- WP Engine: Per-site user access

### What if a client doesn't pay?

**Options:**
- Suspend site access (don't delete immediately)
- Automated suspension via billing integration
- Transfer/migrate site if they want to leave
- Clear contract terms upfront

### How do I handle support requests?

**Options:**

1. **You handle everything:** Client contacts you, you contact host if needed
2. **White-label support:** Some hosts offer this for agencies
3. **Direct access:** Client contacts host directly (less professional)

Most agencies handle support themselves and only escalate to host for server issues.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Match hosting to agency size:** Start simple, upgrade as you grow
2. **White-label matters:** If hosting is part of your service offering
3. **Managed saves time:** Worth the cost for most agencies
4. **Cloudways is versatile:** Works for agencies of all sizes
5. **Reseller for control:** Full white-label and margin opportunities
6. **Plan for handoffs:** Choose hosts that make transfers easy

## What to Do Next

1. **Count your sites:** Current and expected in 12 months
2. **Decide on branding:** Do you need white-label?
3. **Assess technical comfort:** Reseller vs managed
4. **Calculate costs:** Compare per-site costs at your volume
5. **Start with one host:** Migrate others later if needed
