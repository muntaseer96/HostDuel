Switching web hosts feels like a hassle. Migration, DNS changes, potential downtime—it's easier to just stay put.

But sometimes staying with a bad host costs more than switching.

Here are the signs it's time to move, and how to make the transition smoothly.

## Red Flags: When to Switch

### 1. Frequent Downtime

**The problem:** Your site goes down regularly, costing you visitors and credibility.

**What's acceptable:**
- 99.9% uptime = ~43 minutes downtime/month
- 99.95% uptime = ~22 minutes downtime/month
- 99.99% uptime = ~4 minutes downtime/month

**Red flag:** More than 1-2 hours of unexpected downtime per month.

**Check your uptime:** Use UptimeRobot (free) to track actual uptime.

### 2. Consistently Slow Performance

**The problem:** Pages take 4+ seconds to load despite optimization.

**Warning signs:**
- High TTFB (over 600ms) even for simple pages
- Admin dashboard painfully slow
- Speed varies wildly throughout day
- Other sites on same host are also slow

**Rule out other causes first:**
- Optimize images
- Enable caching
- Check plugin issues

If still slow after optimization, hosting is likely the bottleneck.

### 3. Support Is Unhelpful or Slow

**The problem:** When issues arise, support can't or won't help effectively.

**Red flags:**
- Response times over 24 hours for urgent issues
- Canned responses that don't address your problem
- "That's not covered under support"
- Agents don't understand basic WordPress issues
- No escalation path for complex problems

**Expectation:** Quality hosts respond within 1-4 hours for urgent issues.

### 4. Price Jumped Significantly at Renewal

**The problem:** Intro pricing is now 4-6x higher.

**Common scenario:**
- Signed up at $2.99/month
- Renewal is $17.99/month
- Competitor offers $2.99 intro again

**When it's worth switching:**
- Savings outweigh migration effort
- Current host provides no additional value
- Alternatives offer similar or better features

### 5. You've Outgrown Your Plan

**The problem:** Your site has grown beyond what your hosting can handle.

**Signs:**
- "Resource limit reached" errors
- Site crashes during traffic spikes
- Database connection errors under load
- Host suggests you upgrade to dedicated server (expensive)

**Solution:** Often a better-value host handles your traffic at a lower price than your current host's "upgrade."

### 6. Security Incidents

**The problem:** Your site got hacked, or you have security concerns.

**Red flags:**
- Your site was compromised via shared hosting neighbor
- Host was slow to respond to malware
- No automatic backups to restore from
- Host doesn't offer basic security (SSL, firewall)
- Your host itself was breached

**After a security incident:** Consider moving to a host with better security practices.

### 7. Missing Features You Need

**The problem:** Your host lacks features you've come to need.

**Common missing features:**
- Staging environment
- Free SSL certificate
- SSH access
- Modern PHP versions
- Automatic backups
- CDN integration

**Check alternatives:** Many modern hosts include features others charge for.

### 8. They're Pushing You Out

**The problem:** Your host is making it clear they don't want your business.

**Signs:**
- Repeated suspension threats
- Unexplained account restrictions
- Hostile support interactions
- New terms that affect your site

**Take the hint:** Find a host that actually wants your business.

### 9. Company Instability

**The problem:** Signs that your host might not be around long-term.

**Warning signs:**
- Acquired by large conglomerate (support often declines)
- Mass layoffs reported
- Support quality suddenly dropped
- Features being removed
- Price increases without improvement
- Bad press or legal issues

**Action:** Start planning migration before forced to act urgently.

### 10. Your Needs Changed

**The problem:** You now need something different from when you signed up.

**Examples:**
- Started on shared, now need VPS
- Need multiple sites, current plan limits one
- Want managed WordPress, currently on generic
- Going international, need better CDN
- Adding e-commerce, need more security

**Solution:** Find hosting that matches your current needs, not your needs from 3 years ago.

## When NOT to Switch

### Don't switch if:

**1. Problems are your site, not hosting**
- Slow site due to unoptimized images
- Crashes due to bad plugins
- Issues only after you made changes

**2. You haven't given it a fair chance**
- Just signed up
- Haven't tried support yet
- Minor hiccup, not pattern

**3. Switching won't solve the problem**
- Issues will follow you (code problems)
- No host does what you need
- The grass isn't greener

**4. Migration risks outweigh benefits**
- Critical site with zero downtime tolerance
- Complex custom setup
- No clear improvement from switching

## Planning Your Migration

### Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Backup everything (files + database)
- [ ] Document current setup (plugins, settings, email config)
- [ ] Note DNS records
- [ ] Choose a low-traffic time
- [ ] Have support contacts ready
- [ ] Test backup restoration ability

### Migration Options

**1. Host-provided migration (easiest)**

Many hosts offer free migration:
- [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) - Free migration
- [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) - Free migration
- [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) - Free migration
- [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) - Free migration

Let the experts handle it.

**2. Migration plugin (WordPress)**

Tools like:
- All-in-One WP Migration
- Duplicator
- UpdraftPlus

Export from old, import to new.

**3. Manual migration**

For technical users:
- Copy files via SFTP
- Export/import database
- Update wp-config.php
- Test on temporary URL
- Update DNS

### Minimizing Downtime

**Steps:**
1. Set up new hosting
2. Migrate and test using temporary URL
3. Verify everything works
4. Lower DNS TTL 24-48 hours before switch
5. Update DNS during low-traffic period
6. Monitor for 24-48 hours

**Expected downtime:** Minutes to hours during DNS propagation. Many visitors see no downtime if you test thoroughly first.

### What to Watch After Migration

- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] All pages work
- [ ] Forms submit properly
- [ ] E-commerce processes orders
- [ ] Email works (if using hosting email)
- [ ] SSL certificate active
- [ ] Performance improved

## Handling Migration Obstacles

### Email Migration

If using hosting email, this is the trickiest part.

**Options:**
1. **Migrate email to new host** - Export/import mailboxes
2. **Use external email** - Google Workspace, Microsoft 365
3. **Keep email at old host temporarily** - Different MX records

### Domain Locked at Old Host

Some hosts make it hard to transfer domains.

**Solutions:**
- Request unlock code
- Update nameservers even if domain stays
- Transfer domain separately after site migration

### Long Contract Remaining

Locked into 2-3 year contract?

**Options:**
- Wait it out if tolerable
- Eat the cost if savings justify it
- Check money-back guarantee terms

### Custom Server Configuration

Complex setups require careful planning.

**Steps:**
- Document every custom setting
- Match configuration at new host
- Test thoroughly before switching DNS

## FAQ

### How much downtime should I expect?

With proper planning and testing: minimal to none for most visitors. DNS propagation means some visitors might hit old server for 24-48 hours, but if both servers serve your site, they see no downtime.

### Should I switch if support solved my problem?

If they solved it well: Give them another chance. If they solved it poorly, slowly, or condescendingly: Consider switching.

### How do I cancel my old hosting?

After migration is verified working:
1. Cancel auto-renewal first
2. Backup everything one more time
3. Request cancellation per their process
4. Request refund if within guarantee period

### What if my new host is also bad?

It happens. Research thoroughly before switching:
- Read recent reviews
- Ask in communities
- Try monthly billing first if available

### Should I switch hosts or upgrade my plan?

**Switch if:** Host's upgrade is overpriced, or fundamental issues exist
**Upgrade if:** You're happy with host, just need more resources

### Is migration really free?

Many hosts offer free migration. Verify:
- Number of sites included
- Any limitations (size, complexity)
- Estimated completion time
- What "free" actually covers

## Key Takeaways

1. **Frequent downtime and slow speeds** are valid reasons to switch
2. **Bad support** means future problems will hurt more
3. **Price increases** can justify switching—do the math
4. **Plan migration carefully** to minimize downtime
5. **Use host-provided migration** when available (it's free)
6. **Test thoroughly** before updating DNS
7. **Don't stay out of fear**—migration is manageable

## What to Do Next

1. **Assess your current situation** honestly
2. **Document your problems** specifically
3. **Research alternatives** that address those problems
4. **Plan your migration** during low-traffic period
5. **Take the leap** when you're ready
