Many hosting plans advertise "unlimited websites" or "host multiple domains." But what are the real limits? Can you actually run 50 sites on a $5/month shared hosting plan?

Here's the truth about hosting multiple websites on one account.

## Quick Answer by Hosting Type

| Hosting Type | Typical Limit | Realistic Limit |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Basic Shared | 1 site | 1 site |
| Standard Shared | "Unlimited" | 10-30 sites |
| VPS (2GB RAM) | No limit | 20-50 sites |
| VPS (8GB RAM) | No limit | 100+ sites |
| Dedicated | No limit | Hundreds |
| Managed WordPress | Plan-specific | Exactly as stated |

## Shared Hosting: The "Unlimited" Truth

### What "Unlimited Sites" Really Means

Most shared hosting plans advertising unlimited websites have these real limits:

**Hard limits:**
- CPU usage caps
- Memory (RAM) limits
- I/O (disk read/write) limits
- Concurrent process limits
- Database limits (often 20-100)

**What happens when you hit limits:**
- Site slows down
- 503 errors appear
- Host throttles your account
- Host asks you to upgrade

### Realistic Site Counts on Shared Hosting

| Plan Type | Small Sites | Medium Sites | High-Traffic Sites |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Basic ($3-5/mo) | 1-3 | 1 | 0-1 |
| Standard ($5-10/mo) | 5-15 | 3-5 | 1-2 |
| Premium ($10-20/mo) | 15-30 | 5-10 | 2-3 |

**Small site:** Under 1,000 visits/month, simple WordPress or HTML
**Medium site:** 1,000-10,000 visits/month, standard WordPress
**High-traffic:** 10,000+ visits/month

### Popular Shared Hosting Limits

| Host | Plan | Sites Allowed | Database Limit |
|------|------|---------------|----------------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | StartUp | 1 | 1 |
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | GrowBig | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | Single | 1 | 1 |
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | Premium | 100 | 100 |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | Basic | 1 | 1 |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | Plus | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| [DreamHost](/hosting/dreamhost) | Shared | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) | Startup | 1 | 5 |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) | Drive | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## VPS Hosting: Real Scalability

VPS hosting gives you dedicated resources, making multi-site hosting more predictable.

### VPS Capacity Guidelines

| VPS Size | RAM | Sites (WordPress) | Sites (Static) |
|----------|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| Entry | 1GB | 5-10 | 20-50 |
| Small | 2GB | 15-25 | 50-100 |
| Medium | 4GB | 30-50 | 100-200 |
| Large | 8GB | 75-150 | 200-500 |
| XL | 16GB+ | 200+ | 500+ |

**Note:** These assume optimized WordPress with caching. Unoptimized sites need more resources.

### VPS Multi-Site Setup

**Option 1: Control panel (easy)**
- Install cPanel, Plesk, or CyberPanel
- Add sites through GUI
- ~$15-20/month license cost for cPanel

**Option 2: Server management platform**
- [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) - Managed cloud, easy multi-site
- ServerPilot - Simple WordPress management
- RunCloud - Modern control panel

**Option 3: Manual (technical)**
- Configure Nginx/Apache virtual hosts
- No additional cost
- Requires Linux knowledge

## Managed WordPress Hosting

Managed WordPress hosts have explicit site limits per plan:

| Host | Plan | Sites | Price/mo |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Starter | 1 | $35 |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Pro | 2 | $70 |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Business 1 | 5 | $115 |
| [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) | Startup | 1 | $20 |
| [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) | Growth | 10 | $77 |
| [Flywheel](/hosting/flywheel) | Tiny | 1 | $15 |
| [Flywheel](/hosting/flywheel) | Agency | 30 | $290 |

**Why explicit limits matter:**
- Resources actually allocated per site
- Predictable performance
- No surprise throttling
- Clear upgrade path

## Dedicated Servers

Dedicated servers can host hundreds of sites, limited only by:

- Server hardware (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Your management capacity
- Software configuration

**Typical dedicated server capacity:**
- Entry (4 cores, 16GB): 200-500 sites
- Mid-range (8 cores, 32GB): 500-1,000 sites
- High-end (16+ cores, 64GB+): 1,000+ sites

Most agencies and hosting resellers use dedicated servers for this reason.

## How to Add Multiple Sites

### Method 1: Addon Domains

Most common for shared hosting:

1. Register domain elsewhere or with host
2. Go to cPanel → Addon Domains
3. Enter domain name
4. Domain gets its own folder
5. Install WordPress or upload files

**Result:** Separate website at new domain

### Method 2: Subdomains

Free, no additional domain needed:

1. Go to cPanel → Subdomains
2. Create subdomain (blog.yourdomain.com)
3. Gets its own folder
4. Install content

**Best for:** Staging sites, project sites, testing

### Method 3: WordPress Multisite

One WordPress installation, multiple sites:

1. Install WordPress
2. Enable Multisite in wp-config.php
3. Add sites through Network Admin
4. Sites share themes and plugins

**Pros:** Easier updates, shared resources
**Cons:** Complexity, harder to separate later

### Method 4: Subdirectory

Sites in folders of main domain:

- yourdomain.com/site1/
- yourdomain.com/site2/

**Best for:** Related microsites, less common for separate businesses

## Warning Signs You Have Too Many Sites

### Performance Issues

- Pages take 4+ seconds to load
- Random 503 errors
- Admin dashboards are slow
- High TTFB (time to first byte)

### Resource Warnings

- Host emails about resource usage
- cPanel shows high CPU/memory
- "Resource limit reached" errors
- Sites go offline during traffic spikes

### What to Do

1. **Optimize existing sites:** Caching, image compression
2. **Remove unused sites:** Delete dormant projects
3. **Upgrade plan:** More resources
4. **Move to VPS:** Predictable resources
5. **Split across accounts:** Distribute load

## Cost Comparison: One Account vs Multiple

### Scenario: 10 WordPress Sites

**Option A: One shared hosting account**
- SiteGround GrowBig: $4.99/month
- All 10 sites on one account
- Total: ~$5/month

**Option B: Separate shared accounts**
- 10 × SiteGround StartUp: $2.99 × 10 = $30/month
- Each site isolated
- Total: ~$30/month

**Option C: VPS**
- DigitalOcean 4GB: $24/month
- Cloudways managed: $50/month
- Dedicated resources
- Total: $24-50/month

**Verdict:** One shared account is cheapest but riskiest. VPS offers best balance at scale.

## When to Use Multiple Accounts

### Separate accounts recommended for:

1. **Client sites you don't own**
   - Client can take over hosting
   - Issues isolated
   - Billing separation

2. **High-traffic sites**
   - Dedicated resources
   - No impact from other sites

3. **Different owners/businesses**
   - Separate billing
   - Legal separation
   - Access control

4. **Security-sensitive sites**
   - E-commerce stores
   - Sites handling personal data
   - Regulated industries

### One account is fine for:

1. **Your own projects**
   - Personal sites
   - Side projects
   - Testing environments

2. **Related businesses**
   - Same owner
   - Similar traffic levels
   - Shared management

3. **Low-traffic sites**
   - Blogs with minimal traffic
   - Brochure sites
   - Landing pages

## FAQ

### Can I really host unlimited sites on shared hosting?

Technically yes, practically no. "Unlimited" means no hard number limit, but resource caps (CPU, RAM, I/O) effectively limit you. Most shared hosting works well with 10-30 small sites.

### What happens if I add too many sites?

1. Performance degrades gradually
2. You may receive warning emails
3. Host may throttle your account
4. In extreme cases, temporary suspension
5. Asked to upgrade or reduce sites

### Do all my sites share the same resources?

On shared hosting and VPS: Yes. If one site gets traffic spike, others may slow down.

On managed WordPress: Resources are often allocated per site, providing better isolation.

### Can I have sites on different domains?

Yes. You can host completely unrelated domains on the same account:
- mybusiness.com
- myhobby.net
- clientsite.org

Each gets its own folder and can have different content.

### Should I use WordPress Multisite for multiple sites?

**Use Multisite if:**
- Sites are related (same organization)
- You want centralized management
- Sites share themes/plugins
- You understand the complexity

**Don't use Multisite if:**
- Sites are for different clients
- Sites may need to be separated later
- You want simple, isolated installations

### Is one VPS better than multiple shared accounts?

Usually yes at 5+ sites:

| Factor | Multiple Shared | One VPS |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Cost (10 sites) | ~$30/month | ~$24/month |
| Performance | Variable | Consistent |
| Control | Limited | Full |
| Management | Multiple logins | One server |
| Isolation | Good | Requires setup |

## Key Takeaways

1. **"Unlimited" isn't unlimited:** Resource caps limit realistic site counts
2. **Shared hosting:** Good for 10-30 small sites
3. **VPS:** Better for 20+ sites or high-traffic sites
4. **Managed WordPress:** Pay per site, get guaranteed resources
5. **Watch for warnings:** Resource alerts mean time to upgrade
6. **Isolate important sites:** Client sites and e-commerce deserve their own resources

## What to Do Next

1. **Audit your sites:** List all sites and their traffic levels
2. **Check current usage:** Look at hosting resource reports
3. **Plan for growth:** Consider where you'll be in 12 months
4. **Right-size your hosting:** Match hosting type to actual needs
