Portfolio websites and photography sites have unique hosting requirements. High-resolution images, galleries with hundreds of photos, and the need for fast loading times make choosing the right host critical.

Here's what to look for and which hosts deliver for visual-heavy websites.

## Why Portfolio Sites Have Special Needs

### Storage Requirements

Photography portfolios consume significant storage:

| Content Type | Typical Size | 100 Images |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Web-optimized JPG | 200-500KB | 20-50MB |
| High-res JPG | 2-10MB | 200MB-1GB |
| RAW files (if offered) | 25-50MB | 2.5-5GB |
| Video content | 50-500MB each | 5-50GB |

**Reality:** A serious photographer's portfolio can easily require 10-50GB of storage.

### Bandwidth Demands

Image-heavy sites consume more bandwidth:

- **Average page size:** 5-15MB (vs 2-3MB for text sites)
- **Visitor bandwidth:** 50-150MB per session browsing galleries
- **1,000 visitors/month:** 50-150GB bandwidth needed

### Performance Expectations

Visitors expect fast-loading galleries:

- Images should load within 2-3 seconds
- Lazy loading is essential
- CDN integration helps dramatically
- Image optimization matters

**Squarespace/Wix:** Built-in hosting, good for non-technical users
**Format/Pixpa:** Photography-specific platforms
**Self-hosted WordPress:** Most flexibility, requires hosting

For self-hosted solutions, the hosts above all work well.

## Optimizing Your Portfolio Site

### Image Optimization Tips

**Before uploading:**
1. Resize to maximum display size (2000-3000px wide)
2. Save as JPG at 80-85% quality
3. Use tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG

**On your site:**
1. Use lazy loading (loads images as you scroll)
2. Implement responsive images (srcset)
3. Use WebP format with JPG fallback
4. Consider progressive JPGs for large images

### Caching Configuration

**Enable these caching layers:**
1. Browser caching (cache images for 1 year)
2. Server-side caching (page caching)
3. CDN caching (distribute globally)

Most managed WordPress hosts handle this automatically.

### Gallery Best Practices

**For better performance:**
- Limit images per page (20-30 max)
- Use pagination or infinite scroll
- Generate thumbnails at multiple sizes
- Compress gallery plugin output

## FAQ

### How much storage do I really need?

**Calculate:**
- Number of images × average size
- Add 50% buffer for growth
- Consider if offering downloads

**Example:** 500 images × 500KB = 250MB displayed + originals = ~5GB minimum

### Is unlimited storage really unlimited?

Usually yes for reasonable use. "Unlimited" typically means:
- No hard cap on storage
- Fair use policy applies
- Can't use for file storage/backup service

For portfolios, you're unlikely to hit limits unless storing RAW files.

### Should I use a photography-specific platform?

**Consider dedicated platforms if:**
- You want built-in client proofing
- Need print fulfillment integration
- Don't want to manage hosting

**Use self-hosted WordPress if:**
- You want full control
- Need custom functionality
- Want to avoid platform lock-in
- Are comfortable with WordPress

### Do I need a CDN?

**Yes, if:**
- You have international clients
- Image-heavy pages (10+ images)
- Performance matters for SEO/conversions

**Maybe not if:**
- Local business only
- Few images per page
- Just starting out

Many hosts include free CDN, so there's little reason not to use one.

### What about video hosting?

**Don't host videos on your web server.** Instead:
- Use YouTube/Vimeo (free, fast)
- Use dedicated video hosting (Wistia, Bunny.net)
- Embed videos on your pages

This saves storage, bandwidth, and improves performance.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Storage matters:** Get at least 20GB, preferably unlimited
2. **CDN is essential:** For fast image loading globally
3. **Optimize images:** Before and after uploading
4. **Budget options exist:** Hostinger and DreamHost offer great value
5. **Premium pays off:** For high-traffic professional sites
6. **Consider static:** Cloudflare Pages is free and fast for developers

## What to Do Next

1. **Estimate your needs:** Count images, calculate storage
2. **Choose your platform:** WordPress vs dedicated portfolio platform
3. **Pick appropriate host:** Based on budget and traffic expectations
4. **Optimize images:** Set up compression and lazy loading
5. **Enable CDN:** For global performance
