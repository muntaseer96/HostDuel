WordPress powers 43% of all websites. But there are two versions: WordPress.com (hosted for you) and self-hosted WordPress (WordPress.org).

They use the same core software, but they're very different experiences.

Here's how to decide which WordPress is right for you.

## The Key Difference

**WordPress.com:** Automattic (the company) hosts your site. You sign up and start building. They handle servers, security, and updates.

**Self-Hosted WordPress:** You download the software from WordPress.org and install it on your own web hosting. You control everything.

**Analogy:**
- WordPress.com = Renting a furnished apartment (landlord handles maintenance)
- Self-Hosted = Owning a house (you handle everything, but you can renovate freely)

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | WordPress.com | Self-Hosted |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Setup** | 5 minutes | 30+ minutes |
| **Cost** | Free - $45/mo | $3+/mo (hosting) + domain |
| **Custom domain** | Paid plans only | Yes, always |
| **Plugins** | Business plan+ only | Unlimited, any plugin |
| **Themes** | Limited selection | Thousands available |
| **Monetization** | Restricted | Full control |
| **Maintenance** | Automatic | Your responsibility |
| **Ownership** | On their platform | You own everything |

## WordPress.com Plans

WordPress.com offers multiple tiers:

| Plan | Price | Key Features |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Free** | $0 | yoursite.wordpress.com, ads shown, limited |
| **Personal** | $4/mo | Custom domain, no ads |
| **Premium** | $8/mo | Premium themes, basic customization |
| **Business** | $25/mo | Plugin install, SFTP, backup |
| **Commerce** | $45/mo | Full WooCommerce, payment processing |

**Important:** Plugin and theme freedom only starts at the Business plan ($25/mo).

## Self-Hosted WordPress Costs

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|------------|
| Web hosting | $3-35/mo |
| Domain name | $10-15/year |
| Premium theme | $0-60 (one-time) |
| Premium plugins | $0-200/year (optional) |
| SSL certificate | Usually free |

**Typical total:** $5-15/mo for a fully-featured WordPress site.

**Comparison:** WordPress.com Business ($25/mo) vs self-hosted with quality hosting ($5-15/mo) — self-hosted is often cheaper with more features.

## Feature Comparison

**WordPress.com:**
- Free plan: ~100 themes, limited customization

## When to Choose WordPress.com

### Best For:

**Complete beginners**
- No technical knowledge

### WordPress.com Makes Sense When:

- Your site is simple and will stay simple

## When to Choose Self-Hosted

### Best For:

**Business websites**

- Theme development

**Anyone wanting ownership**
- Full control over your content

### Self-Hosted Makes Sense When:

- Ownership and portability matter

## Cost Comparison: 3-Year Analysis

### Scenario 1: Simple Blog

**WordPress.com Personal:** $4/mo × 36 = $144

**Self-Hosted ([Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger)):**
- Hosting: ~$3/mo × 36 = $108
- Domain: $12 × 3 = $36
- Total: $144

**Verdict:** Similar cost, but self-hosted has more flexibility.

### Scenario 2: Business Website

**WordPress.com Business:** $25/mo × 36 = $900

**Self-Hosted ([SiteGround](/hosting/siteground)):**
- Hosting: ~$10/mo avg × 36 = $360
- Domain: $12 × 3 = $36
- Premium theme: $60 (one-time)
- Total: $456

**Verdict:** Self-hosted saves $444 over 3 years with more features.

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Store

**WordPress.com Commerce:** $45/mo × 36 = $1,620

**Self-Hosted ([Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways)):**
- Hosting: $14/mo × 36 = $504
- Domain: $12 × 3 = $36
- WooCommerce: Free
- Premium plugins: ~$200/year × 3 = $600
- Total: $1,140

**Verdict:** Self-hosted saves $480 with more payment options.

## Migration Considerations

### WordPress.com to Self-Hosted

**Process:**
1. Export content from WordPress.com
2. Set up self-hosted WordPress
3. Import content
4. Redirect WordPress.com URL (requires paid plan)
5. Recreate design and functionality

**Difficulty:** Moderate. Content transfers easily; design requires rebuilding.

**Note:** WordPress.com free/Personal plans can't redirect. Visitors may find old URL.

### Self-Hosted to WordPress.com

**Why you might:**
- Want to stop managing hosting
- Simplify maintenance

**Process:**
1. Export content from self-hosted site
2. Sign up for WordPress.com (Business for plugin parity)
3. Import content
4. Accept feature limitations
5. Point domain to WordPress.com

**Reality:** Rarely done. You usually lose functionality.

## Common Misconceptions

### "WordPress.com is free"

The free tier exists but has:
- yoursite.wordpress.com URL
- WordPress.com ads on your site
- Very limited features

For a professional site, you'll pay $8-45/month.

### "Self-hosted WordPress is hard"

With modern hosts, it's straightforward:
- One-click WordPress install
- Automatic updates available
- Quality hosts handle security basics
- Millions of non-technical people run self-hosted sites

### "WordPress.com is more secure"

WordPress.com handles security, but self-hosted WordPress with a quality host and security plugin is also very secure. Security depends more on practices than platform.

### "Self-hosted means you host it yourself"

No. You use a web hosting company. They maintain servers; you manage WordPress. You're not running servers in your house.

### "You can switch easily later"

Content migrates, but:
- Themes don't transfer (rebuild design)
- Some plugins have no WordPress.com equivalent
- Redirects require paid plan on WordPress.com

Plan ahead rather than assuming easy migration.

## Decision Framework

### Choose WordPress.com If:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Hobby blog, no monetization | Free or Personal |
| Want zero maintenance | Business plan |
| Simple site, convenience priority | Premium or Business |
| Temporary site | Free |

### Choose Self-Hosted If:

| Situation | Recommended Host |
|-----------|------------------|
| Budget business site | [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) |
| Professional business site | [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) |
| E-commerce store | [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) |
| High-traffic blog | [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) |
| Agency/multiple sites | [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) |

## FAQ

### Which is better for SEO?

Self-hosted, due to full access to SEO plugins and technical optimizations. WordPress.com Business plan narrows the gap but still has limitations.

### Can I use Elementor/Beaver Builder on WordPress.com?

Only on Business plan and above. On self-hosted, you can use any page builder on any hosting plan.

### Is WordPress.com or .org the "real" WordPress?

Both use WordPress software. WordPress.org is the open-source project; WordPress.com is a commercial service using that software.

### Can I sell products on WordPress.com free plan?

No. E-commerce requires the Commerce plan ($45/mo). Self-hosted lets you use WooCommerce for free (plus hosting costs).

### What if I start on WordPress.com and outgrow it?

You can migrate to self-hosted. Content transfers well; design and functionality may need rebuilding. It's doable but requires work.

### Do big websites use WordPress.com?

Some do (their VIP tier), but most large WordPress sites are self-hosted for maximum control and cost efficiency.

## Key Takeaways

1. **WordPress.com is easier** but more expensive for features
2. **Self-hosted gives full control** at lower cost for most use cases
3. **WordPress.com Business** ($25/mo) is the minimum for serious sites
4. **Self-hosted with quality hosting** costs $5-15/mo with full flexibility
5. **Choose WordPress.com** for true simplicity without monetization needs
6. **Choose self-hosted** for business sites, e-commerce, or serious blogging

## What to Do Next

**If you're unsure, start self-hosted.** It's more flexible and often cheaper. You can always simplify later; it's harder to add flexibility.

**Recommended self-hosted setup:**
1. Choose hosting: [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) or [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) for beginners
2. Register your domain (often free with hosting)
3. One-click WordPress install
4. Choose a theme and essential plugins
5. Start creating content
