GoDaddy is the world's largest domain registrar and one of the most advertised web hosts. But is their hosting actually good? Or are you paying for marketing?

Here's an honest assessment of GoDaddy hosting—the good, the bad, and whether you should use them.

## Quick Verdict

**GoDaddy hosting is... mediocre.**

It's not terrible, but there are better options at similar prices. GoDaddy's strength is domains and convenience, not hosting quality.

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | Average speed, okay uptime |
| Value | ⭐⭐ | Overpriced for what you get |
| Ease of Use | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good for beginners |
| Support | ⭐⭐⭐ | Hit or miss quality |
| Features | ⭐⭐⭐ | Basic, some upsells |

**Bottom line:** Fine for simple sites if you're already a GoDaddy customer. Better alternatives exist for the same price.

## GoDaddy Hosting Options

## The Good

### 1. Convenience

If you already use GoDaddy for domains, keeping hosting there is convenient:
- One login for everything
- Simplified DNS management
- Consolidated billing
- Easy domain connection

### 2. Beginner-Friendly

GoDaddy's dashboard is straightforward:
- Clear interface
- Website builders included
- One-click WordPress install
- Guided setup process

### 3. Wide Product Range

Everything in one place:
- Domains
- Hosting
- Email
- SSL certificates
- Website builder
- Marketing tools

### 4. 24/7 Support

Support is always available:
- Phone support
- Live chat
- Extensive knowledge base
- Active community

### 5. Money-Back Guarantee

48-hour guarantee on hosting (30 days for annual plans) provides some protection.

## The Bad

### 1. Performance is Average

**Speed tests show:**
- TTFB: 400-800ms (average)
- Uptime: ~99.9% (acceptable, not great)
- Page load: Slower than competitors

**Comparison:**
| Host | Avg. TTFB | Uptime |
|------|-----------|--------|
| GoDaddy | 600ms | 99.9% |
| SiteGround | 350ms | 99.99% |
| Cloudways | 250ms | 99.99% |

### 2. Aggressive Upselling

GoDaddy is infamous for upselling:

**During checkout:**
- SSL certificate ($79.99/yr - free elsewhere)
- SiteLock security ($7.99/mo)
- Website backup ($2.99/mo)
- SEO tools ($6.99/mo)
- Professional email ($5.99/mo)

**Many of these are free or cheaper elsewhere.**

### 3. Renewal Price Jump

| Plan | Year 1 | Year 2+ | Increase |
|------|--------|---------|----------|
| Economy | $71.88 | $131.88 | +83% |
| Deluxe | $95.88 | $167.88 | +75% |
| Ultimate | $155.88 | $239.88 | +54% |

The renewal jump is significant and higher than many competitors.

### 4. Basic Features

What's missing or costs extra:

| Feature | GoDaddy | Competitors |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Free SSL | Paid ($79/yr) | Usually free |
| Daily backups | Paid | Often included |
| Staging | No | Often included |
| Free migration | No | Often included |
| CDN | Paid | Often included |

### 5. Overcrowded Servers

Reports of shared hosting performance issues suggest overcrowded servers:
- Inconsistent speeds
- Occasional slowdowns
- Resource limits hit easily

### 6. Customer Service Quality

Support is available but quality varies:
- Long wait times reported
- Scripts-heavy responses
- Upselling during support calls
- Technical depth lacking

### GoDaddy Doesn't Make Sense If:

❌ Performance matters to you
❌ You want the best value
❌ You need staging environments
❌ You want included SSL/backups
❌ You're price-sensitive long-term

## If You're Already on GoDaddy

### Should You Stay?

**Stay if:**

- You're not paying for extras
- Migration seems daunting
- No specific complaints

**Switch if:**
- Performance issues
- Paying for features that are free elsewhere
- Renewal price is too high
- Need staging or better tools

### How to Migrate Away

1. **Choose new host** with free migration
2. **Backup your site** (files + database)
3. **Let new host migrate** (SiteGround, Cloudways do this free)
4. **Test on new host**
5. **Update DNS** to point to new host
6. **Cancel GoDaddy** after DNS propagates

Most migrations take 24-48 hours with minimal downtime.

## Tips for GoDaddy Users

### Avoiding Upsells

1. **Decline everything at checkout** - You can add later if needed
2. **Get SSL elsewhere** - Let's Encrypt is free, Cloudflare offers free SSL
3. **Use free backup plugins** - UpdraftPlus works great
4. **Skip SiteLock** - Use Wordfence (free) instead

### Reducing Costs

1. **Look for promo codes** - They're always available
2. **Buy domains separately** - Often cheaper at Namecheap
3. **Use annual billing** - Cheapest per-month rate
4. **Call to negotiate renewal** - Sometimes works

### Getting Better Support

1. **Call instead of chat** - Usually better
2. **Be specific** about your issue
3. **Ask for escalation** if needed
4. **Use knowledge base** for simple issues

## FAQ

### Is GoDaddy reliable?

Reasonably. Uptime is around 99.9%, which means occasional downtime. Not the best, not the worst.

### Why is GoDaddy so popular?

Marketing. GoDaddy spends heavily on advertising (Super Bowl ads, etc.) and has name recognition. They're also the largest domain registrar, which brings hosting customers.

### Is GoDaddy secure?

Basic security is fine. However, many security features (SSL, SiteLock, backup) cost extra when competitors include them free.

### Can I transfer my domain away from GoDaddy?

Yes. Domains can be transferred to any registrar after 60 days. Hosting can be moved anytime without moving the domain.

### Is GoDaddy good for WordPress?

It works, but not optimized. SiteGround, Kinsta, or WP Engine are much better for WordPress specifically.

### Does GoDaddy own other hosting companies?

Yes. GoDaddy owns Media Temple and several other brands. They're part of a large hosting conglomerate.

## Key Takeaways

1. **GoDaddy is convenient** but not the best value
2. **Performance is average** compared to competitors
3. **Upselling is aggressive** - decline extras at checkout
4. **Renewal prices jump significantly** - plan for this
5. **Better alternatives exist** at similar or lower prices
6. **Fine for simple sites** if you're already there

## Final Verdict

**GoDaddy hosting is a 6/10.**

It works. It's not going to ruin your website. But you're paying a premium for the brand name while getting average performance and paying extra for features that competitors include free.

**Our recommendation:** If you're starting fresh, choose [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) or [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) instead. If you're already on GoDaddy and it's working fine, you don't *need* to switch—but know that better options exist.
