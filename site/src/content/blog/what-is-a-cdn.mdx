A CDN (Content Delivery Network) makes your website load faster by storing copies of your content on servers around the world.

Instead of everyone loading your site from one server, visitors get content from a server near them.

Here's everything you need to know about CDNs—in plain language.

## What Is a CDN?

A CDN is a network of servers spread across the globe. These servers store copies of your website's static content (images, CSS, JavaScript, fonts) and serve it to visitors from the nearest location.

### How It Works

**Without a CDN:**
```
Visitor in London → Your Server in New York → Content travels 5,500km → Slow
```

**With a CDN:**
```
Visitor in London → CDN Server in London → Content travels 50km → Fast
```

The CDN has "edge servers" or "points of presence" (PoPs) in dozens or hundreds of locations. When someone visits your site, they get content from the nearest one.

### What a CDN Caches

CDNs primarily cache static content:

| Content Type | Cached? | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Images | Yes | Photos, logos, icons |
| CSS files | Yes | Stylesheets |
| JavaScript | Yes | Scripts, libraries |
| Fonts | Yes | Web fonts |
| Videos | Yes | Media files |
| PDFs | Yes | Downloads |
| HTML pages | Sometimes | Blog posts, static pages |
| Dynamic content | No | Shopping carts, user dashboards |

### Real Speed Improvement

A visitor 5,000km from your server experiences about 50ms of network latency per request. With 50 requests to load a page:

- **Without CDN:** 50 × 50ms = 2.5 seconds of latency
- **With CDN (local):** 50 × 5ms = 0.25 seconds of latency

That's a 2+ second improvement just from the CDN—before any optimization.

## Do You Need a CDN?

### You Probably Need One If:

**1. You have visitors from multiple countries**

If 30%+ of your traffic comes from outside your server's region, a CDN significantly improves their experience.

**2. Your site has lots of images**

Image-heavy sites benefit most. Each image request saves time when served from a CDN edge server.

**3. Speed matters to your business**

E-commerce sites, SaaS applications, and any site where speed affects conversions.

**4. You're hitting performance limits**

A CDN offloads static file delivery from your server, reducing load and improving response times.

**5. You want better security**

Most CDNs include DDoS protection, SSL, and security features.

### You Might Not Need One If:

**1. Your audience is purely local**

A bakery in Portland serving Portland customers doesn't need global content delivery.

**2. Your site is tiny**

A 5-page site with optimized images loads fast regardless.

**3. Your host already includes a CDN**

Some hosts like [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) and [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) include CDN in their plans.

**4. Budget is extremely tight**

Start without one and add it later. But Cloudflare's free tier makes this argument weak.

## Best CDN Options

**Our recommendation:** Start with Cloudflare free. It's genuinely excellent and costs nothing.

## How to Set Up a CDN

### Option 1: Cloudflare (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Create a free Cloudflare account

**Step 2:** Add your website
- Enter your domain
- Cloudflare scans your DNS records

**Step 3:** Update nameservers
- Cloudflare gives you two nameservers
- Update these at your domain registrar
- Propagation takes minutes to 24 hours

**Step 4:** Configure settings
- Set SSL to "Full (strict)"
- Enable "Always Use HTTPS"
- Enable Brotli compression
- Set caching level

**Step 5:** Test
- Check your site loads correctly
- Test from different locations using GTmetrix

### Option 2: Host-Provided CDN

Some hosts include CDN:

| Host | CDN Included | Setup |
|------|--------------|-------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | Yes (Cloudflare) | One-click in dashboard |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Yes (KeyCDN) | Automatic |
| [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) | Yes (Cloudflare) | One-click |
| [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) | Yes (proprietary) | Automatic |
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | Yes (on higher plans) | One-click |

If your host includes a CDN, use it. It's already integrated and configured.

### Option 3: WordPress Plugin

If you can't change nameservers, some CDNs offer WordPress plugins:

- **Cloudflare Plugin**: Works alongside DNS setup
- **WP Rocket**: Includes CDN service
- **Bunny CDN Plugin**: Direct integration

## CDN Settings That Matter

### Caching Rules

**What to cache:**
- Images (forever, with versioning)
- CSS/JS (long cache, use versioning)
- Fonts (forever)
- Static pages (1 hour to 1 day)

**What not to cache:**
- Shopping cart pages
- User account pages
- Admin areas
- POST requests

### Cache TTL (Time to Live)

| Content Type | Recommended TTL |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Images | 1 year |
| CSS/JS | 1 year (version your files) |
| Fonts | 1 year |
| HTML pages | 1-24 hours |
| API responses | Depends on data freshness needs |

### Security Settings

**Enable:**
- HTTPS everywhere
- HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- TLS 1.3
- Bot protection
- Firewall rules for /wp-admin, /admin

**Consider:**
- Rate limiting
- Geographic blocking (if needed)
- Challenge pages for suspicious traffic

## Common CDN Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Old Content Showing

**Cause:** CDN serving cached version of updated content

**Solutions:**
1. Purge cache in CDN dashboard
2. Use versioned URLs (style.css?v=2)
3. Set appropriate cache TTL
4. Use cache tags for selective purging

### Problem: Site Broken After CDN Setup

**Cause:** Usually SSL/HTTPS configuration mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Set Cloudflare SSL to "Full (strict)"
2. Ensure your origin has valid SSL
3. Check for mixed content warnings
4. Review page rules

### Problem: Admin Area/Login Issues

**Cause:** CDN caching dynamic content

**Solutions:**
1. Create bypass rule for /wp-admin/
2. Add bypass for logged-in users
3. Check cookie handling settings

### Problem: Slow Dynamic Content

**Cause:** CDN can't cache personalized content

**Solutions:**
1. Use AJAX for dynamic parts
2. Consider edge computing (Cloudflare Workers)
3. Optimize origin server
4. This is expected—CDN helps static, not dynamic content

## CDN Performance Testing

### How to Test CDN Effectiveness

**1. Test before and after:**
- Run GTmetrix tests before CDN setup
- Run same tests after setup
- Compare TTFB and fully loaded time

**2. Test from multiple locations:**
- GTmetrix: Test from 7 locations
- WebPageTest: More location options
- Pingdom: Quick multi-location tests

**3. Check cache hit ratio:**
- Cloudflare dashboard shows hit ratio
- Aim for 80%+ cache hit rate
- Low hit rate = configuration issue

### What to Look For

**Good CDN performance:**
- TTFB under 100ms from most locations
- 80%+ cache hit ratio
- Similar load times globally
- "CF-Cache-Status: HIT" in headers

**Poor CDN performance:**
- TTFB varies wildly by location
- Low cache hit ratio
- Frequent "MISS" or "BYPASS" statuses

## FAQ

### Does a CDN replace web hosting?

No. A CDN caches and delivers your content, but you still need hosting for your origin server. The CDN gets content from your host and distributes it globally.

### Will a CDN make my slow site fast?

A CDN improves content delivery speed, but won't fix a slow server, unoptimized images, or bloated code. It's one piece of the performance puzzle.

### Is Cloudflare really free?

Yes. The free tier is genuinely useful and not artificially limited. Millions of sites use it. Paid tiers add features but aren't required.

### Can I use a CDN with shared hosting?

Absolutely. CDNs work with any hosting. They sit between your visitors and your server, regardless of your hosting type.

### Do CDNs help with SEO?

Indirectly. Faster sites rank better, and CDNs make sites faster. The speed improvement from a CDN contributes to better Core Web Vitals scores.

### What's the difference between CDN and caching?

Caching stores content to serve it faster. A CDN is a distributed cache—storing content on servers worldwide. CDN = caching + geographic distribution.

### My host says they have a CDN. Is that enough?

Usually yes. Host-provided CDNs like those from [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) or [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) are well-configured and sufficient for most sites. You don't need to add another.

### How much bandwidth do I need on a CDN?

Check your current bandwidth usage in your hosting dashboard. A typical blog uses 10-50GB/month. With Cloudflare free or Bunny CDN's cheap pricing, bandwidth cost is negligible for most sites.

## Key Takeaways

1. **A CDN delivers content from servers near your visitors**, reducing latency
2. **Cloudflare free is excellent** for most websites
3. **CDNs help static content** (images, CSS, JS), not dynamic content
4. **Setup is easy**—usually just changing nameservers or one-click
5. **Test performance** before and after to measure improvement
6. **Cache settings matter**—configure TTL and bypass rules properly

## What to Do Next

1. **Check if your host includes a CDN**—use it if so
2. **Sign up for Cloudflare free** if you need a CDN
3. **Configure caching rules** appropriately
4. **Test from multiple locations** to verify improvement
5. **Monitor cache hit ratio** in your CDN dashboard
