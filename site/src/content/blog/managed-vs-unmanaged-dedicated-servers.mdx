Dedicated servers represent a significant investment. Should you add management costs on top, or handle administration yourself?

Here's how to decide between managed and unmanaged dedicated servers.

## The Difference

### Unmanaged Dedicated Server

**You get:** Physical server, network connection, power
**You handle:** Everything else (OS, security, updates, troubleshooting)

**Typical cost:** $50-300/month

### Managed Dedicated Server

**You get:** Fully administered server
**Provider handles:** OS, security, updates, monitoring, support

**Typical cost:** $150-600/month

## Cost Comparison

| Server Class | Unmanaged | Managed | Difference |
|--------------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Entry | $70/mo | $200/mo | +$130/mo |
| Mid-range | $150/mo | $350/mo | +$200/mo |
| High-end | $300/mo | $600/mo | +$300/mo |

## When to Choose Each

### Unmanaged If:

- You have dedicated sysadmin staff
- You need complete custom configuration
- Budget is primary concern
- You enjoy server management

### Managed If:

- No in-house server expertise
- Uptime is critical
- You need support availability
- Your time is more valuable than the cost difference

## What Management Includes

**Typical managed services:**
- Initial server setup
- OS installation and hardening
- Security patches and updates
- Monitoring and alerting
- Basic troubleshooting
- Firewall configuration
- Backup setup

**Usually NOT included:**
- Application support
- Code debugging
- Custom software installation

## Key Takeaways

1. **Management adds $100-300/month** to server cost
2. **Calculate your time value** when comparing
3. **Business-critical servers** usually warrant management
4. **Hybrid options exist** (basic management, partial support)
