"Do I need web hosting?" is one of the most common questions beginners ask. The answer depends entirely on which platform you're using.

Some platforms include hosting. Others require you to buy it separately. Here's a clear breakdown so you know exactly what you need.

## Quick Answer: Platform Hosting Requirements

| Platform | Hosting Included? | What You Need |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| WordPress.org | ❌ No | Buy hosting separately |
| WordPress.com | ✅ Yes | Included in plans |
| Shopify | ✅ Yes | Included in subscription |
| Wix | ✅ Yes | Included in plans |
| Squarespace | ✅ Yes | Included in subscription |
| Webflow | ✅ Yes | Included in plans |
| Weebly | ✅ Yes | Included in plans |
| Ghost (Pro) | ✅ Yes | Included in subscription |
| Ghost (Self-hosted) | ❌ No | Buy hosting separately |

**The rule:** Website builders include hosting. Self-hosted platforms don't.

## WordPress: The Confusing One

WordPress is where most confusion happens because there are two versions.

### WordPress.org (Self-Hosted)

**You NEED separate hosting.**

WordPress.org is free software you download and install on your own server. You must:

1. Buy web hosting ([Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger), [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground), etc.)
2. Install WordPress on that hosting
3. Manage updates, backups, and security yourself

**Pros:**
- Complete control and customization
- Any plugin or theme allowed
- Own your content entirely
- Better for SEO (more control)

**Cons:**
- Must purchase hosting ($3-30/month)
- Responsible for maintenance
- Steeper learning curve

**Best hosting for WordPress.org:**
- Budget: [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) - $2.99/month
- Quality: [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) - $2.99/month
- Premium: [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) - $35/month

See our full guide: [Best WordPress Hosting 2026](/blog/best-wordpress-hosting)

### WordPress.com (Hosted)

**Hosting is INCLUDED.**

WordPress.com is a service that hosts WordPress for you. You sign up, pay monthly, and they handle everything.

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0/mo | Basic blog, WordPress.com subdomain |
| Personal | $4/mo | Custom domain, no ads |
| Premium | $8/mo | Monetization, premium themes |
| Business | $25/mo | Plugins, themes, advanced SEO |
| eCommerce | $45/mo | Full store features |

**Pros:**
- No technical setup
- Automatic updates and security
- Built-in backups

**Cons:**
- Limited customization on free/cheap plans
- Can't install plugins until Business plan ($25/mo)
- Less control than self-hosted

### WordPress.org vs WordPress.com: Which to Choose?

| Scenario | Best Choice |
|----------|-------------|
| Simple personal blog | WordPress.com Free |
| Business website | WordPress.org + hosting |
| Custom functionality needed | WordPress.org + hosting |
| E-commerce store | WordPress.org + WooCommerce |
| Tight budget, need plugins | WordPress.org + [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) |
| No technical knowledge at all | WordPress.com |

**Our recommendation:** Most serious websites should use WordPress.org with separate hosting. It's more flexible and often cheaper than WordPress.com Business plans.

## Shopify: Hosting Always Included

**You do NOT need separate hosting for Shopify.**

Shopify is an all-in-one e-commerce platform. Your subscription includes:
- Web hosting
- SSL certificate
- CDN for fast loading
- Unlimited bandwidth
- Automatic security updates

### Shopify Pricing

| Plan | Price | Transaction Fee |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Basic | $29/mo | 2.9% + 30¢ |
| Shopify | $79/mo | 2.6% + 30¢ |
| Advanced | $299/mo | 2.4% + 30¢ |

**What you DO need:**
- Domain name ($10-15/year, or use Shopify's)
- That's it—hosting is covered

### When Shopify Might Not Be Enough

Some merchants eventually want:
- Complete control over hosting performance
- Lower transaction fees
- Custom backend functionality

In those cases, they migrate to WooCommerce (WordPress.org + hosting). See [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) or [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) for WooCommerce hosting.

## Wix: Hosting Always Included

**You do NOT need separate hosting for Wix.**

Wix includes hosting with all plans, including the free tier.

### Wix Pricing

| Plan | Price | Storage | Bandwidth |
|------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Free | $0/mo | 500MB | 500MB |
| Combo | $16/mo | 3GB | Unlimited |
| Unlimited | $22/mo | 10GB | Unlimited |
| Pro | $27/mo | 20GB | Unlimited |
| VIP | $45/mo | 35GB | Unlimited |

**Included with all plans:**
- Web hosting
- Free SSL
- Global CDN
- Automatic mobile optimization

**What you need to buy:**
- Domain name (or use free Wix subdomain)
- Premium plan to remove Wix ads

### Wix Limitations

Wix hosting is decent but has constraints:
- Can't migrate your Wix site to another host
- Limited server-side customization
- Performance can vary on complex sites

For simple sites (portfolios, small business), Wix hosting works fine. For high-traffic or complex sites, self-hosted solutions offer more control.

## Squarespace: Hosting Always Included

**You do NOT need separate hosting for Squarespace.**

Like Wix, Squarespace is an all-in-one platform.

### Squarespace Pricing

| Plan | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Personal | $16/mo | Basic website |
| Business | $23/mo | Analytics, pop-ups |
| Commerce Basic | $27/mo | Sell products |
| Commerce Advanced | $49/mo | Advanced e-commerce |

**Included:**
- Hosting
- SSL certificate
- CDN
- Unlimited storage and bandwidth

**Best for:** Creatives, portfolios, small businesses wanting beautiful templates without technical work.

## Webflow: Hosting Included (With Options)

**Webflow includes hosting, but you can export code.**

Webflow is unique—it's a website builder that generates clean code you can optionally host elsewhere.

### Webflow Hosting (Included)

| Site Plan | Price | Features |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Starter | $0/mo | 2 pages, Webflow subdomain |
| Basic | $14/mo | 150 pages, custom domain |
| CMS | $23/mo | Blog, dynamic content |
| Business | $39/mo | 10K CMS items |

### Self-Hosting Webflow Exports

You can export Webflow HTML/CSS/JS and host it anywhere:
- [Netlify](/hosting/netlify) - Free tier available
- [Vercel](/hosting/vercel) - Free tier available
- Any static hosting

**Note:** Exported sites lose CMS functionality. Dynamic content requires Webflow hosting.

## Ghost: Two Options

**Ghost Pro includes hosting. Self-hosted Ghost doesn't.**

### Ghost Pro (Hosted)

| Plan | Price | Members |
|------|-------|---------|
| Starter | $9/mo | Up to 500 |
| Creator | $25/mo | Up to 1,000 |
| Team | $50/mo | Up to 1,000 |
| Business | $199/mo | Up to 10,000 |

Hosting, updates, and backups included.

### Self-Hosted Ghost

You need a VPS with Node.js support:
- [DigitalOcean](/hosting/digitalocean) - $5/mo droplet works
- [Vultr](/hosting/vultr) - $5/mo instance
- [Hetzner](/hosting/hetzner) - From $3.79/mo

More technical but more control and potentially cheaper for large audiences.

## Static Site Generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby)

**You need hosting, but it can be free.**

Static site generators create HTML files you deploy to a host.

### Free Static Hosting Options

| Host | Free Tier | Custom Domain |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| GitHub Pages | Unlimited | Yes |
| Netlify | 100GB/mo | Yes |
| Vercel | 100GB/mo | Yes |
| Cloudflare Pages | Unlimited | Yes |

For most static sites, free hosting is plenty.

### When to Pay

Consider paid hosting ([Netlify Pro](/hosting/netlify), [Vercel Pro](/hosting/vercel)) when you need:
- Team collaboration
- Serverless functions
- More build minutes
- Priority support

## Cost Comparison: Included vs Separate Hosting

Let's compare total costs for a basic business website:

### Website Builder (Hosting Included)

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Wix Combo | $16/mo | $192/yr |
| Squarespace Personal | $16/mo | $144/yr (billed annually) |
| Webflow Basic | $14/mo | $168/yr |

### WordPress.org + Separate Hosting

| Setup | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Hostinger + WordPress | ~$3/mo | ~$36/yr |
| SiteGround + WordPress | ~$3-15/mo | ~$36-180/yr |
| Kinsta + WordPress | $35/mo | $420/yr |

**The math:** Self-hosted WordPress can be significantly cheaper, but requires more technical involvement. Website builders cost more but handle everything for you.

## FAQ

### What is web hosting exactly?

Web hosting is a service that stores your website files on a server connected to the internet. When someone visits your domain, the server delivers your website to their browser. Learn more in our [What Is Web Hosting](/blog/what-is-web-hosting) guide.

### Why do some platforms include hosting and others don't?

Website builders (Wix, Squarespace, Shopify) are complete services—you pay for the software AND hosting together. Open-source platforms (WordPress.org, Ghost self-hosted) are free software you install on hosting you provide.

### Is included hosting good quality?

Generally yes. Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace hosting is reliable for their use cases. However, you have no control over server configuration, and performance is one-size-fits-all.

### Can I switch from included hosting to separate hosting?

Depends on the platform:
- **WordPress.com → WordPress.org:** Yes, WordPress.com offers export tools
- **Wix/Squarespace → Elsewhere:** Difficult, sites don't export well
- **Shopify → WooCommerce:** Yes, with migration tools

### Which is better: included hosting or separate?

Neither is universally better:
- **Included hosting:** Easier, less technical, good for simple sites
- **Separate hosting:** More control, often cheaper, better for growth

Choose based on your technical comfort and website needs.

### Do I need hosting for a landing page?

Depends on how you build it:
- Carrd, Linktree, etc. - No, hosting included
- Custom HTML page - Yes, but free options like Netlify work
- WordPress landing page - Yes, need hosting

## Summary

| Platform | Need Hosting? | Best For |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| WordPress.org | ✅ Yes | Full control, serious sites |
| WordPress.com | ❌ No | Simple blogs, beginners |
| Shopify | ❌ No | E-commerce stores |
