Backups save you when things go wrong—hacks, accidental deletions, failed updates, or hosting disasters.

But how often should you backup your website? The answer depends on how frequently your site changes and how much data you can afford to lose.

Here's how to figure out the right backup frequency for your site.

## The Simple Rule

**Backup as often as your site changes.**

| Site Type | Change Frequency | Minimum Backup Frequency |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Static brochure site | Monthly | Weekly |
| Blog with weekly posts | Weekly | Daily |
| Active blog or news | Daily | Daily |
| E-commerce store | Hourly | Multiple times daily |
| High-traffic membership | Constantly | Real-time/hourly |

If you publish a blog post today and your backup is from a week ago, you'd lose that post in a recovery scenario.

## Understanding Backup Frequency

### What "Daily Backup" Actually Means

A daily backup creates a snapshot of your site once every 24 hours, typically at a set time (often 2-4 AM when traffic is low).

**What you could lose:** Up to 24 hours of changes

If your daily backup runs at 3 AM and you make changes at 2 PM, then disaster strikes at 11 PM, you lose 20 hours of work.

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

RPO is the maximum acceptable data loss, measured in time.

| RPO | Meaning | Backup Frequency Needed |
|-----|---------|------------------------|
| 24 hours | Can lose up to 1 day of data | Daily backups |
| 4 hours | Can lose up to 4 hours | 6 backups per day |
| 1 hour | Can lose up to 1 hour | Hourly backups |
| 0 (zero data loss) | Can't lose any data | Real-time replication |

**Determine your RPO:** Ask yourself, "If I had to restore from a backup right now, how much lost data would seriously hurt?"

## Backup Frequency by Website Type

### Static/Brochure Sites

**Characteristics:**
- Content rarely changes
- No user-generated content
- Updates maybe monthly

**Recommended:** Weekly automatic backups + backup before any changes

**Why:** Low change frequency means low data loss risk. But always backup before making changes (updates, redesigns).

### Blogs and Content Sites

**Characteristics:**
- Regular content publishing
- Comments (if enabled)
- Occasional updates

**Recommended:** Daily automatic backups

**Why:** A week's worth of blog posts is significant work to recreate. Daily backups limit loss to one day maximum.

### E-commerce Stores

**Characteristics:**
- Orders placed constantly
- Inventory changes
- Customer data updates
- Revenue at stake

**Recommended:** Multiple times daily (every 4-6 hours) minimum

**Why:** Losing a day of orders is unacceptable. Each order represents customer money and trust. More frequent backups reduce potential loss.

### Membership/Community Sites

**Characteristics:**
- User-generated content constantly
- Profiles, posts, interactions
- Subscribers paying for access

**Recommended:** Hourly or real-time database backups

**Why:** User content can't be recreated. Losing even a few hours of user activity causes serious problems and trust issues.

### High-Traffic SaaS

**Characteristics:**
- Constant data changes
- Business-critical operations
- Contracts and compliance requirements

**Recommended:** Real-time replication + regular snapshots

**Why:** Any data loss has business impact. Real-time backups or database replication ensure near-zero data loss.

## What to Backup

### Complete Website Backup Includes:

**1. Files**
- WordPress core files
- Theme files
- Plugin files
- Uploaded media (images, PDFs, videos)
- Custom code

**2. Database**
- Posts, pages, content
- User information
- Orders and transactions
- Settings and configuration
- Comments

**3. Configuration**
- `.htaccess` file
- `wp-config.php` (excluding sensitive data)
- Server configuration (if managed)

### Backup Size Considerations

| Component | Typical Size | Change Frequency |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Database | 10MB - 1GB | Constant |
| Core files | 50-100MB | Rarely |
| Themes/plugins | 50-200MB | Occasionally |
| Media uploads | 500MB - 50GB+ | As you add content |

**Tip:** Database backups are small and should be frequent. File backups (especially media) are large and can be less frequent since media files rarely change once uploaded.

### Incremental vs Full Backups

**Full backup:** Everything, every time
- Pros: Simple, complete
- Cons: Large storage requirements, slow

**Incremental backup:** Only changes since last backup
- Pros: Fast, storage-efficient
- Cons: More complex to restore

**Recommended strategy:**
- Weekly full backup
- Daily incremental backups
- Combine for complete restore capability

## Hosting Backup Policies

Different hosts offer different backup features:

| Host | Backup Frequency | Retention | Included |
|------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | Daily | 30 days | Yes |
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | Weekly-Daily | 7 days | Most plans |
| [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) | Hourly available | 1+ weeks | Yes |
| [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) | Daily + hourly | 14-30 days | Yes |
| [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) | Daily | 30-60 days | Yes |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | Daily | 30 days | Paid add-on |
| [DigitalOcean](/hosting/digitalocean) | Manual/snapshots | You decide | Paid add-on |

### Hosting Backups Aren't Enough

Don't rely solely on your host's backups:

**Problems with host-only backups:**
- If host has catastrophic failure, backups may be affected
- Some hosts keep backups on the same infrastructure
- You can't access backups if account is suspended
- Retention periods may be shorter than you need

**Solution:** Always maintain your own off-site backups in addition to hosting backups.

## Off-Site Backup Storage

### The 3-2-1 Rule

- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different storage types
- **1** copy off-site

**Example implementation:**
1. Your live website (copy 1)
2. Hosting provider backup (copy 2, same site)
3. Off-site backup to cloud storage (copy 3, different location)

### Off-Site Storage Options

| Service | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Google Drive | Free 15GB, $2/mo 100GB | Easy plugin integration |
| Dropbox | Free 2GB, $10/mo 2TB | Popular, well-supported |
| Amazon S3 | ~$0.023/GB/mo | Scalable, reliable |
| Backblaze B2 | ~$0.006/GB/mo | Cheapest cloud storage |
| Google Cloud Storage | ~$0.02/GB/mo | Scalable, reliable |

**Recommended for most sites:** Google Drive or Dropbox free tier handles small sites. For larger sites or more backups, Backblaze B2 offers the best value.

## Backup Tools and Plugins

### WordPress Backup Plugins

**Free options:**

| Plugin | Features | Off-Site Options |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| UpdraftPlus | Full backups, scheduling | Google Drive, Dropbox, S3 |
| All-in-One WP Migration | Full site export | Limited |
| Duplicator | Site duplication, backups | Limited in free |
| BackWPup | Database + file backups | Dropbox, S3, more |

**Paid options:**

| Plugin | Cost | Features |
|--------|------|----------|
| UpdraftPlus Premium | $70/year | More destinations, incremental, cloning |
| BlogVault | $89/year | Real-time, staging, security |
| VaultPress/Jetpack Backup | $10/mo | Real-time, easy restore |
| ManageWP | $2/mo per site | Multi-site management |

**Our recommendation:** UpdraftPlus (free) for most sites. Set up automatic backups to Google Drive or Dropbox.

### Non-WordPress Options

**cPanel Backup:**
Most shared hosting includes cPanel backup features.

**Server-level backups:**
For VPS, use tools like:
- `rsync` for file synchronization
- `mysqldump` for database exports
- Automated scripts with cron jobs

**Managed hosting:**
[Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) and [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) include managed backup solutions.

## Setting Up Automatic Backups

### Basic WordPress Setup (UpdraftPlus)

1. Install UpdraftPlus plugin
2. Go to Settings → UpdraftPlus Backups
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Set file backup schedule (daily recommended)
5. Set database backup schedule (daily minimum)
6. Choose remote storage (Google Drive)
7. Authenticate with your Google account
8. Set retention (keep 7-14 backups)
9. Save changes

**Test your backup:** Do a manual backup, then test restore on a staging site.

### E-commerce Setup (More Frequent)

For WooCommerce stores, consider:

**Option 1: UpdraftPlus Premium**
- Set database backups every 4 hours
- Set file backups daily
- Store 14+ database backups

**Option 2: BlogVault or VaultPress**
- Real-time incremental backups
- Every change is captured
- Worth the cost for active stores

**Option 3: Hosting-level**
- [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) offers hourly backup add-on
- [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) offers hourly backups

### Multi-Site Management

Managing multiple sites? Use a centralized tool:

- **ManageWP:** Free for basic backups, $2/site for scheduled
- **InfiniteWP:** Self-hosted, one-time fee
- **MainWP:** Free self-hosted option

## Backup Testing

**Backups are useless if you can't restore from them.**

### Test Your Backups Regularly

**Monthly testing checklist:**
1. Download a recent backup
2. Set up a test environment (staging or local)
3. Restore the backup
4. Verify site functionality
5. Check database content is correct

### What to Verify

- [ ] Home page loads correctly
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] Recent content is present
- [ ] User data is intact
- [ ] E-commerce orders exist (if applicable)
- [ ] Forms and functionality work

### Common Restore Problems

| Issue | Cause | Prevention |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Missing images | Media not included | Ensure full backup includes uploads |
| Database errors | Corrupted backup | Test backups regularly |
| Wrong URLs | Hard-coded URLs | Use relative URLs or search-replace on restore |
| Missing plugins | Plugin files excluded | Include all wp-content in backup |

## Backup Retention

### How Long to Keep Backups

| Site Type | Minimum Retention | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Static site | 4 backups | 8 backups |
| Blog | 7 backups | 14-30 backups |
| E-commerce | 14 backups | 30+ backups |
| Compliance-regulated | Per requirements | Often 1-7 years |

**Why longer retention matters:**
- Malware might go undetected for weeks
- You might need to restore specific old content
- Some issues only become apparent later

### Storage Costs

With incremental backups and compression:
- Small blog: 1-5GB total
- Medium site: 5-20GB total
- Large e-commerce: 50-200GB+ total

At Backblaze B2 rates ($0.006/GB), 100GB costs ~$0.60/month.

## FAQ

### Can I rely on my host's backups?

As your only backup? No. Host backups are convenient, but keep your own off-site backups too. If your hosting account is compromised or the host has a catastrophic failure, you need independent copies.

### How do I backup a large site with many images?

1. Backup database frequently (small, changes often)
2. Backup files incrementally (only changes)
3. Use cloud storage with no caps (S3, Backblaze)
4. Consider media optimization to reduce backup size

### Should I backup before every update?

Yes. Before updating WordPress core, themes, or plugins, create a backup. Most backup plugins have a "backup now" button for this.

### My host says they have "automatic backups." Is that enough?

Check:
- How often? (Daily is minimum for active sites)
- How long kept? (7 days is bare minimum)
- Can you restore yourself? (Some require support tickets)
- Where are they stored? (Same server = risk)

If any answers are unsatisfactory, supplement with your own backups.

### What's the difference between backup and staging?

**Backup:** A copy of your site for disaster recovery
**Staging:** A copy for testing changes before applying to production

You need both. Backups save you from disasters. Staging prevents disasters.

### How much does website backup cost?

| Approach | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Host-included backups | $0 (included) |
| UpdraftPlus + Google Drive | $0 |
| UpdraftPlus Premium + Backblaze | ~$6/mo |
| BlogVault | ~$7/mo |
| Kinsta hourly backups | $20/mo add-on |

For most sites, free solutions work perfectly.

## Backup Schedule Recommendations

### Small Blog or Business Site

| What | Frequency | Storage |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Database | Daily | Google Drive |
| Files | Daily | Google Drive |
| Retention | 14 backups | |
| Test restore | Monthly | |

### Active E-commerce Store

| What | Frequency | Storage |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Database | Every 4-6 hours | Amazon S3 |
| Files | Daily | Amazon S3 |
| Retention | 30+ backups | |
| Test restore | Weekly | |

### Membership/SaaS Site

| What | Frequency | Storage |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Database | Hourly or real-time | Multi-region cloud |
| Files | Daily | Multi-region cloud |
| Retention | 30-90 days | |
| Test restore | Weekly | |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Backup as often as your site changes**
2. **Daily backups are the minimum** for most active sites
3. **Store backups off-site**, not just on your host
4. **Test your backups regularly**—untested backups aren't reliable
5. **Automate everything**—manual backups are forgotten backups
6. **Retain enough history** to recover from slow-developing problems

## What to Do Next

1. **Check your current backup situation** (host backups, plugins)
2. **Install UpdraftPlus** and connect to cloud storage
3. **Set up automatic schedules** appropriate for your site
4. **Test a restore** to verify everything works
5. **Set a monthly reminder** to verify backups are running
