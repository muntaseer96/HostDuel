You migrated to a new web host and now email doesn't work. You can't send, can't receive, or both. This is one of the most common post-migration issues.

Here's how to diagnose and fix email problems after switching hosts.

## Why Email Breaks After Migration

### Common Causes

1. **MX records changed or deleted** - Most common cause
2. **DNS not fully propagated** - Takes up to 48 hours
3. **Email hosting changed unintentionally** - Was using old host's email
4. **SPF/DKIM records missing** - Affects deliverability
5. **Mail client settings wrong** - Server addresses changed

### Quick Diagnosis

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Can't receive email | MX records wrong |
| Can't send email | SMTP settings or SPF issue |
| Email goes to spam | SPF/DKIM missing |
| Email delayed | DNS propagation |
| Webmail doesn't work | Email hosting changed |

## Step 1: Check Your MX Records

MX (Mail Exchange) records tell the internet where to deliver your email.

### How to Check MX Records

**Using MXToolbox:**
1. Go to mxtoolbox.com
2. Enter your domain
3. Check MX Lookup results

**Using command line:**
```bash
dig yourdomain.com MX
# or
nslookup -type=mx yourdomain.com
```

### What MX Records Should Look Like

**If using hosting email (cPanel, Plesk):**
```
Priority: 0
Mail Server: mail.yourdomain.com
# or
Priority: 0
Mail Server: yourdomain.com
```

**If using Google Workspace:**
```
Priority: 1  → ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Priority: 5  → ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Priority: 5  → ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Priority: 10 → ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
Priority: 10 → ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
```

**If using Microsoft 365:**
```
Priority: 0
Mail Server: yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com
```

### How to Fix MX Records

**In your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Namecheap, etc.):**

1. Log into DNS management
2. Find MX records section
3. Delete incorrect MX records
4. Add correct MX records for your email provider
5. Save and wait for propagation (up to 48 hours)

## Step 2: Identify Your Email Setup

### Where Is Your Email Actually Hosted?

**Scenario A: Email with old host**
- You were using old host's email (cPanel email)
- MX records pointed to old host
- Website moved, but email needs to stay

**Fix:** Point MX records back to old host's mail server

**Scenario B: Email with new host**
- You want email at new host
- Need to set up email accounts on new host
- Update MX records to new host

**Fix:** Create email accounts on new host, update MX records

**Scenario C: Third-party email (Google, Microsoft)**
- Email with Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoho
- MX records should point to email provider
- Website migration shouldn't affect email

**Fix:** Verify MX records still point to email provider

### Finding Old Host's Mail Server

Contact old host or check documentation:

| Host | Typical Mail Server |
|------|---------------------|
| GoDaddy | secureserver.net |
| Bluehost | mail.yourdomain.com |
| SiteGround | yourdomain.com |
| HostGator | mail.yourdomain.com |
| Namecheap | privateemail.com (if using their email) |

## Step 3: Fix Common Issues

### Issue 1: MX Records Point to Wrong Server

**Symptoms:**
- Not receiving email
- Emails bounce back to sender

**Fix:**
1. Determine correct mail server (see above)
2. Update MX records in DNS
3. Wait for propagation

### Issue 2: SPF Record Missing or Wrong

SPF tells receiving servers which servers can send email for your domain.

**Symptoms:**
- Sent emails go to spam
- Emails rejected by some recipients

**Check SPF:**
```bash
dig yourdomain.com TXT | grep spf
```

**Example SPF records:**

For hosting email:
```
v=spf1 a mx include:_spf.yourhostingdomain.com ~all
```

For Google Workspace:
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

For Microsoft 365:
```
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all
```

**Fix:** Add correct SPF record as TXT record in DNS.

### Issue 3: DKIM Not Set Up

DKIM cryptographically signs your emails, improving deliverability.

**Symptoms:**
- Emails occasionally go to spam
- Failed DKIM in email headers

**Fix:**
1. Get DKIM key from email provider
2. Add as TXT record in DNS
3. Usually named: `default._domainkey.yourdomain.com`

### Issue 4: Mail Client Settings Wrong

If webmail works but desktop/mobile doesn't:

**Check these settings:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Incoming server | mail.yourdomain.com or provider's server |
| Incoming port | 993 (IMAP SSL) or 995 (POP3 SSL) |
| Outgoing server | mail.yourdomain.com or smtp.provider.com |
| Outgoing port | 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS) |
| Username | full email address |
| Authentication | Required for outgoing |

### Issue 5: DNS Not Propagated

**Symptoms:**
- Some people can email you, others can't
- Works intermittently

**Fix:** Wait up to 48 hours. Check propagation at whatsmydns.net.

## Step 4: Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario: Moved to New Host, Want New Host's Email

**Steps:**
1. Create email accounts on new host (cPanel → Email Accounts)
2. Note the mail server (usually mail.yourdomain.com)
3. Update MX records to point to new host
4. Add SPF record for new host
5. Set up DKIM if available
6. Update mail client settings
7. Wait for DNS propagation

### Scenario: Moved Website, Keep Email at Old Host

**Steps:**
1. Keep email accounts at old host (don't delete!)
2. Find old host's mail server
3. Update MX records to point to OLD host
4. Update SPF to include old host
5. Website DNS (A record) points to new host
6. Email DNS (MX record) points to old host

**DNS will look like:**
```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       new.host.ip.address
MX      @       mail.oldhost.com
```

### Scenario: Moved Website, Use Google Workspace

**Steps:**
1. Verify MX records point to Google
2. Check SPF includes Google
3. Website A record points to new host
4. Email should be unaffected

**If email stopped working:**
- Check if MX records were accidentally changed
- Restore Google's MX records

### Scenario: Want to Move Email to Google Workspace

**Steps:**
1. Set up Google Workspace account
2. Add users and verify domain
3. Update MX records to Google
4. Add Google SPF record
5. Set up DKIM in Google Admin
6. Export emails from old host (if needed)

## Email Migration Best Practices

### Before Migration

1. **Document current DNS records** (screenshot everything)
2. **Note email provider** (hosting, Google, Microsoft)
3. **Lower DNS TTL** to 300 seconds (5 minutes) 24 hours before
4. **Backup emails** if switching email providers

### During Migration

1. **Don't delete email accounts** on old host yet
2. **Keep MX records pointing to current email** provider
3. **Only change A/CNAME records** for website

### After Migration

1. **Test email** (send and receive)
2. **Check spam folders** of recipients
3. **Verify SPF/DKIM** with mail-tester.com
4. **Monitor for 48-72 hours**
5. **Then** cancel old hosting if email moved

## Testing Your Email

### Test Receiving

1. Send email to yourself from external address (Gmail, etc.)
2. Check if it arrives
3. Check spam folder

### Test Sending

1. Send email to external address
2. Check if recipient receives it
3. Ask if it went to spam

### Test Authentication

**Using mail-tester.com:**
1. Go to mail-tester.com
2. Send email to the provided address
3. Check your score
4. Fix any SPF/DKIM issues flagged

**Using Google's header analyzer:**
1. Send email to Gmail account
2. Open email, click three dots → Show original
3. Check SPF, DKIM, DMARC status

## FAQ

### How long until email works after fixing DNS?

MX record changes can take 1-48 hours to propagate. Most propagate within 4-6 hours.

### Can I use different hosts for website and email?

Yes, this is common. A/CNAME records point to website host, MX records point to email host.

### My email works but goes to spam. Why?

Usually missing or incorrect SPF/DKIM records. Test at mail-tester.com.

### Should I use hosting email or third-party?

**Use hosting email if:**
- Budget is limited
- Low volume email
- Simple needs

**Use third-party (Google, Microsoft) if:**
- Email is critical
- Need reliability/features
- Want email separate from hosting

### What if I lost emails during migration?

Check:
1. Old host's email (might still be there)
2. Email client's local storage
3. Contact old host for backup restoration

Prevention: Always backup emails before migration.

### My host says email is set up correctly but it doesn't work

Check:
1. DNS propagation (whatsmydns.net)
2. MX records point to correct server
3. No conflicting MX records
4. SPF record is correct
5. Try from different email client

## Quick Reference: Common Email Providers' DNS Settings

### Google Workspace

**MX Records:**
```
1 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
5 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
5 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
10 ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
10 ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM
```

**SPF:** `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all`

### Microsoft 365

**MX:** `yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com`

**SPF:** `v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all`

### Zoho Mail

**MX:** `mx.zoho.com` (priority 10), `mx2.zoho.com` (priority 20)

**SPF:** `v=spf1 include:zoho.com ~all`

## Key Takeaways

1. **MX records are the #1 cause** of post-migration email issues
2. **Document everything** before migrating
3. **Website and email can use different hosts** - they're separate DNS records
4. **SPF/DKIM are crucial** for deliverability
5. **Wait 48 hours** for full DNS propagation
6. **Test thoroughly** before declaring success

## What to Do Next

1. **Diagnose:** Check MX records at mxtoolbox.com
2. **Identify:** Determine where email should be hosted
3. **Fix:** Update DNS records as needed
4. **Test:** Verify sending and receiving works
5. **Monitor:** Watch for issues over next 48 hours
