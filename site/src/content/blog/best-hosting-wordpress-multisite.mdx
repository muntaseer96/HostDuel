WordPress Multisite lets you run multiple websites from a single WordPress installation. It's powerful, but it needs the right hosting.

Not every host supports Multisite well. Here's what you need to know before setting up a WordPress network.

## What Is WordPress Multisite?

WordPress Multisite turns one WordPress installation into a network of sites sharing:
- Core WordPress files
- Themes (available to all sites)
- Plugins (activated network-wide or per-site)
- User database

**Use cases:**
- **Blogs network:** Like WordPress.com's hosted blogs
- **University sites:** Departments sharing infrastructure
- **Franchise sites:** Multiple locations, same branding
- **Client management:** Agencies hosting client sites
- **Multilingual sites:** Language-specific subsites

## Multisite vs Multiple Installations

| Aspect | Single Multisite | Multiple Separate Installs |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Management** | One dashboard | Separate dashboards |
| **Updates** | Update once, affects all | Update each separately |
| **Themes/plugins** | Shared, but can control | Independent per site |
| **User accounts** | Shared across network | Separate per site |
| **Isolation** | Less isolated | Fully isolated |
| **Complexity** | More complex | Simpler per site |
| **Best for** | Related sites, same owner | Unrelated sites, different owners |

**Important:** Multisite isn't always the right choice. If sites need different plugins or complete isolation, separate installations may be better.

## Hosting Requirements for Multisite

### Domain/URL Structure

Multisite supports two URL structures:

**Subdomains:** site1.yourdomain.com, site2.yourdomain.com
- Requires wildcard DNS
- Requires wildcard SSL

**Subdirectories:** yourdomain.com/site1, yourdomain.com/site2
- Simpler to set up
- One SSL certificate works

**Different domains (domain mapping):** site1.com, site2.com
- Requires plugin and DNS configuration
- Most complex setup

### Hosting Must Support

| Requirement | Why Needed |
|-------------|------------|
| **Wildcard subdomains** | For subdomain multisite |
| **Wildcard SSL** | HTTPS on all subdomains |
| **Sufficient resources** | Multiple sites = more load |
| **mod_rewrite** | URL handling |
| **Not restricted** | Some hosts block multisite |

### Resource Considerations

Multisite uses more resources than single sites:

**Database:**
- Shared tables (users, usermeta)
- Per-site tables (posts, options, etc.)
- Database size grows with each site

**Memory:**
- Each site request loads WordPress
- Active sites can hit PHP memory limits
- Recommend 256MB+ PHP memory

**Storage:**
- Media uploads per site
- Themes and plugins shared
- Grows with content

**CPU:**
- Multiple sites = more processing
- Cron jobs multiply
- Consider server capacity

## Shared Hosting Limitations

Many shared hosts either don't support Multisite or support it poorly.

### Common Restrictions

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **No wildcard subdomains** | Can't use subdomain structure |
| **No wildcard SSL** | SSL issues on subdomains |
| **Low resource limits** | Sites slow or crash |
| **Limited sites allowed** | Artificial caps |
| **Blocked by host** | Outright prohibited |

### Shared Hosts and Multisite

| Host | Multisite Support |
|------|-------------------|
| [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) | Supported on GrowBig+ |
| [Hostinger](/hosting/hostinger) | Supported (check limits) |
| [Bluehost](/hosting/bluehost) | Supported but limited |
| [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) | Supported |
| [GoDaddy](/hosting/godaddy) | Limited |

**Reality check:** Shared hosting can work for small networks (3-5 low-traffic sites) but isn't ideal for production multisite networks.

## Best Hosting Types for Multisite

## Setting Up Multisite

### Basic Setup Steps

**1. Fresh WordPress install** (easier than converting existing)

**2. Edit wp-config.php:**
```php
/* Multisite */
define( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );
```

**3. Complete network setup in WordPress admin**
- Go to Tools → Network Setup
- Choose subdomain or subdirectory
- Follow instructions

**4. Update wp-config.php and .htaccess**
WordPress provides the code to add.

**5. Configure host settings**
- Wildcard subdomains (if using subdomain structure)
- Wildcard SSL certificate

**6. Create sites in Network Admin**

### Domain Mapping Setup

To use different domains for network sites:

**1. Install domain mapping plugin** (WordPress MU Domain Mapping or similar)

**2. Add domains to your hosting**

**3. Point DNS for each domain to your server**

**4. Configure SSL for each domain**

**5. Map domains in WordPress**

This is more complex than subdomain/subdirectory setups.

## Multisite Performance Optimization

### Caching

Standard caching is more complex with multisite:
- Must cache per-site
- Some caching plugins need multisite-compatible configuration
- Host-level caching often works best

**Recommended:**
- [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) and [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine) handle this
- On VPS: Redis object caching + page caching
- On shared: WP Super Cache (multisite compatible)

### CDN

CDN helps multisite performance:
- Cloudflare works with multisite
- Configure for subdomain or subdirectory structure
- Wildcard SSL on CDN if using subdomains

### Database Optimization

Multisite databases grow large:
- Regular cleanup (WP-Optimize)
- Remove spam comments and revisions
- Optimize database tables

### Resource Monitoring

Watch for:
- PHP memory limits being hit
- Database connection limits
- Storage filling up
- CPU spikes during traffic

## Common Multisite Issues

### Problem: Wildcard SSL Not Working

**Cause:** Host doesn't support or hasn't configured wildcard SSL

**Solution:**
- Confirm host supports wildcard SSL
- Use Let's Encrypt wildcard (requires DNS validation)
- Consider Cloudflare for SSL management

### Problem: Subdomain Sites Not Resolving

**Cause:** Wildcard DNS not configured

**Solution:**
- Add wildcard DNS record: `*.yourdomain.com → server IP`
- Wait for DNS propagation

### Problem: Plugin Conflicts

**Cause:** Plugin not multisite-compatible

**Solution:**
- Check plugin documentation for multisite support
- Test on staging network first
- Use multisite-specific plugins when available

### Problem: Running Out of Resources

**Cause:** Network outgrew shared hosting

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to VPS or managed hosting
- Add resources (RAM, CPU)
- Optimize existing sites

## FAQ

### How many sites can I run on one multisite?

Technically unlimited. Practically limited by:
- Server resources
- Hosting plan limits
- Management complexity

10-50 sites is manageable. 100+ requires significant resources and management tools.

### Is multisite good for client sites?

Mixed opinions:
- **Pro:** Centralized management, single updates
- **Con:** Less isolation, harder to transfer sites to clients

Many agencies prefer separate installations for client independence.

### Can I convert existing WordPress to multisite?

Yes, but it's complex:
- Existing content becomes the main site
- Existing users gain network roles
- Some URL restructuring may be needed
- Backup thoroughly before attempting

Starting fresh is easier if possible.

### Does each multisite count against host limits?

Depends on host:
- **Kinsta/WP Engine:** Network counts as 1 site
- **Cloudways:** No limits (resource-based)
- **Shared hosts:** Varies, check terms

### Can sites on my network have different themes?

Yes. Themes are uploaded once but activated per-site. Each site chooses its own active theme from network-available themes.

### What happens if the main site goes down?

All sites in the network go down. They share the same WordPress installation. This is a key consideration for critical sites.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Multisite needs specific hosting features** (wildcard SSL, subdomains)
2. **Shared hosting works for small networks** but not long-term production
3. **Managed WordPress hosts** ([Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta), [WP Engine](/hosting/wpengine)) make multisite easy
4. **Cloud hosting** ([Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways)) offers flexibility and value
5. **Consider if multisite is right** for your use case before committing
6. **Resource needs grow** with your network—plan for scaling

## What to Do Next

**Before starting multisite:**
1. Confirm your use case fits multisite
2. Choose subdomain vs subdirectory structure
3. Select hosting with proper multisite support

**Recommended path:**
- Small/testing: [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) GrowBig
- Production: [Cloudways](/hosting/cloudways) or [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta)
- Enterprise: [Kinsta](/hosting/kinsta) higher tiers or custom VPS
