SSH access gives you command-line control over your hosting server. For developers, it's often essential for deployment, debugging, and server management.

Here's where to find hosting with proper SSH access and what you can do with it.

## Why Developers Need SSH

### What SSH Enables

| Debug issues | Limited logs in panel | Full server access |
| Install tools | Request from host | Do it yourself |
| Run scripts | Can't | Full control |
| Database management | phpMyAdmin only | MySQL CLI |
| File management | Web file manager | vim, nano, rsync |
| Cron jobs | Limited GUI | Full crontab |

### When You Need SSH

## Setting Up SSH Access

### Generating SSH Keys

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
# Press Enter for default location
# Enter passphrase (recommended)
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
```

### Adding Key to Host

**Typical process:**
1. Copy public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
2. Log into hosting dashboard
3. Find SSH Keys section
4. Paste public key
5. Save

### Connecting

```bash
ssh username@your-server.com
# or with custom port
ssh username@your-server.com -p 18765
```

## What You Can Do with SSH

### Git Deployment

```bash
# On server
cd ~/public_html
git pull origin main
```

**Better:** Set up deployment keys for automated pulls.

### Package Management

```bash
# PHP (Composer)
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

# Node.js
npm install --production

# Laravel
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
```

### WordPress CLI

```bash
# Update WordPress
wp core update

# Update plugins
wp plugin update --all

# Search-replace
wp search-replace 'old-domain.com' 'new-domain.com'

# Database export
wp db export backup.sql
```

### Database Operations

```bash
# MySQL CLI
mysql -u username -p database_name

# Export database
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup.sql

# Import database
mysql -u username -p database_name < backup.sql
```

### File Operations

```bash
# Find large files
find . -type f -size +10M

# Search in files
grep -r "search_term" ./

# Compress directory
tar -czvf backup.tar.gz directory/

# Sync files
rsync -avz ./local/ user@server:~/remote/
```

### Process Management

```bash
# Check running processes
ps aux | grep php

# Kill process
kill -9 PID

# Check memory
free -m

# Check disk
df -h
```

## SSH Security Best Practices

### Use SSH Keys (Not Passwords)

**Why:**
- More secure than passwords
- Can't be brute-forced
- Easy to revoke

**Disable password auth (VPS):**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Set: PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Use Strong Passphrases

Add passphrase to your SSH key for extra security layer.

### Limit Access

**On VPS:**
- Change default SSH port
- Use fail2ban to block attacks
- Whitelist IP addresses if possible

### Keep Keys Secure

- Don't share private keys
- Use different keys for different servers
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## FAQ

### Does all hosting have SSH?

No. Many budget shared hosts don't offer SSH, or only on higher tiers. Always check before signing up.

### What's the difference between SSH and SFTP?

**SSH:** Command-line access to run commands
**SFTP:** Secure file transfer (like FTP but encrypted)

Most hosts provide both when SSH is enabled.

### Can I get root access on shared hosting?

No. Shared hosting shares server resources with other users. Root access would be a security risk. For root access, use VPS.

### Is SSH safe?

Yes, SSH is encrypted. Use SSH keys instead of passwords for maximum security.

### Do I need SSH for WordPress?

Not strictly necessary, but helpful for:
- WP-CLI commands
- Git deployments
- Database management
- Debugging

Many WordPress developers prefer hosts with SSH.

### What if SSH is blocked by my network?

Try:
- Different port (some hosts use non-standard ports)
- VPN connection
- Mobile hotspot

## Key Takeaways

1. **Shared hosting SSH is limited** - No root, restricted commands
2. **VPS gives full control** - Root access, install anything
3. **Managed cloud is middle ground** - SSH for apps, not server
4. **Use SSH keys** - More secure than passwords
5. **Check before signing up** - Not all hosts offer SSH

## What to Do Next

1. **Assess your needs:** What commands do you need to run?
2. **Choose appropriate hosting type:** Shared, VPS, or managed
3. **Set up SSH keys:** More secure than passwords
4. **Learn basic commands:** Git, composer, database operations

Need hosting with SSH? [SiteGround](/hosting/siteground) and [A2 Hosting](/hosting/a2hosting) offer good SSH on shared hosting. For full control, [DigitalOcean](/hosting/digitalocean) or [Vultr](/hosting/vultr) provide root access. Compare options with our [hosting comparison tool](/compare).
