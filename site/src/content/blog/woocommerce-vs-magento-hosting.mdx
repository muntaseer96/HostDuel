WooCommerce and Magento are the two most popular self-hosted e-commerce platforms, but their hosting requirements differ dramatically.

Here's what you need to know about hosting each platform.

## Resource Requirements

| Requirement | WooCommerce | Magento 2 |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Minimum RAM | 512MB | 2GB |
| Recommended RAM | 2-4GB | 4-8GB |
| PHP Version | 7.4-8.2 | 8.1-8.2 |
| Database | MySQL/MariaDB | MySQL/MariaDB |
| Storage | 5GB+ | 10GB+ |
| Complexity | Low-Medium | High |

**Key difference:** Magento requires significantly more resources and technical expertise.

## Hosting Costs Compared

### Small Store (< 1,000 products)

| Platform | Hosting Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| WooCommerce | $3-30/mo | Shared or managed WP |
| Magento | $50-150/mo | VPS minimum |

### Medium Store (1,000-10,000 products)

| Platform | Hosting Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| WooCommerce | $30-100/mo | Managed WP or VPS |
| Magento | $150-500/mo | Dedicated or cloud |

## Which Should You Choose?

2. **Magento needs VPS minimum** — no shared hosting
3. **Technical complexity** is higher with Magento
4. **For most stores**, WooCommerce is more practical
5. **Enterprise scale** may justify Magento's costs
