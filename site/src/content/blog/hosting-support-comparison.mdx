### Escalation Strategies

**If first agent can't help:**

1. **Ask politely:** "Can this be escalated to a senior technician?"
2. **Explain why:** "This has been ongoing for X days"
3. **Request callback:** From supervisor or specialist
4. **Try different channel:** Phone if chat fails
5. **Document everything:** Names, ticket numbers, times

### When Support Fails

**Options:**
- Ask for supervisor/manager
- Contact via social media (Twitter)
- File BBB complaint
- Dispute charges (if service not delivered)
- Switch hosts (sometimes the answer)

## FAQ

### Is 24/7 support really 24/7?

Usually yes, but:
- Quality may vary by shift
- Complex issues might wait for specialists
- Phone support sometimes limited hours
- Holidays may have reduced staff

### Why do I keep getting transferred?

Common reasons:
- First tier can only handle basics
- Technical issues need specialists
- Billing vs technical separation
- Department boundaries

**Solution:** Ask for direct transfer to appropriate department upfront.

### Should I use chat or phone?

**Use chat if:**
- Issue is simple
- You need written record
- Can't talk on phone
- Outside phone hours

**Use phone if:**
- Site is down (urgent)
- Issue is complex
- You prefer verbal explanation
- Chat isn't resolving it

### How do I get support to actually help?

1. Be specific and detailed
2. Provide evidence (screenshots)
3. State what you've already tried
4. Ask for ticket number
5. Follow up if no resolution
6. Escalate when needed

### Is premium support worth paying for?

Rarely. Instead:
- Choose host with good included support
- Most issues don't need premium response
- Exception: Business-critical sites with strict uptime needs

## Key Takeaways

1. **Support quality varies hugely** between hosts
2. **Match channel to problem** - phone for urgent, tickets for complex
3. **Document everything** - before and during contact
4. **Prepare details** before contacting support
5. **Escalate when needed** - politely but firmly
