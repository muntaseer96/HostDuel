## FAQ

### Can I use shared hosting for Python?

Most traditional shared hosts don't support Python well. Use PaaS or VPS instead.

### What about serverless for Python?

AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Vercel support Python for serverless functions.

### Django or Flask—does hosting differ?

Same hosting works for both. Django is slightly more resource-intensive.

## Key Takeaways

1. **PythonAnywhere** is easiest for beginners
2. **Render/Railway** are modern PaaS options
3. **VPS** gives most control for production
