# Hosting Comparison Data Collection - Continuation          
                                                               
  ## Project Overview                                          
  I'm building a hosting comparison website. We're collecting  
  comprehensive data for 50+ hosting companies stored in JSON  
  format.                                                      
                                                               
  ## File Structure                                            
  - `/Users/muntaseerrahman/Downloads/TOOLS/hosting-comparison-
  tool/data/index.json` - Company manifest (completed + pending
   list)                                                       
  - `/Users/muntaseerrahman/Downloads/TOOLS/hosting-comparison-
  tool/data/schema.json` - 124-field schema definition         
  - `/Users/muntaseerrahman/Downloads/TOOLS/hosting-comparison-
  tool/data/companies/` - Individual company JSON files        
                                                               
  ## Completed Companies (5)                                   
  1. GoDaddy                                                   
  2. Namecheap                                                 
  3. Hostinger                                                 
  4. IONOS                                                     
  5. Bluehost                                                  
                                                               
  ## Requirements                                              
  1. **One company at a time** - Complete one, show fill rate, 
  wait for "proceed" before next                               
  2. **Target 85%+ fill rate** - Use `null` only for genuinely 
  unfindable data                                              
  3. **Priority "niche" fields**: renewal pricing, inode       
  limits, money-back exclusions, content policies              
  (adult/gambling), hidden fees, suspension policies           
  4. **Editorial fields required**: Fill `knownIssues`,        
  `bestFor`, `avoidIf`, `competitorComparisonNotes` based on   
  objective data found                                         
  5. **Data sources**: Official websites, web searches,        
  Trustpilot/G2/BBB for ratings                                
                                                               
  ## To Continue                                               
  1. Read `index.json` to see the pending companies list       
  2. Read one existing company file (e.g., `hostinger.json`) to
   see the data format                                         
  3. Research the next pending company (SiteGround is next)    
  4. Create the JSON file following the exact schema           
  5. Update `index.json` (add to companies array, remove from  
  pendingCompanies)                                            
  6. Report fill rate and key findings                         
                                                               
  Start by reading the index.json and proceed with the next    
  company.
