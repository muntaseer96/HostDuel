CLAUDE CODE PROMPT: HOSTING COMPARISON DATA COLLECTION
=========================================================

## PROJECT CONTEXT & LONG-TERM GOAL

I am building a hosting comparison website that will help users find the best web hosting provider for their needs. The website will feature:

1. A comprehensive searchable/filterable table comparing 50+ international hosting companies
2. Niche data points that other comparison sites don't collect (renewal pricing, content policies, hidden fees, etc.)
3. User reviews for trust-building
4. Monetization through affiliate marketing once traffic is established

The key differentiator is collecting NICHE information that people can't easily find elsewhere — this is our SEO strategy. We're targeting long-tail queries like "hosting with free staging environment under $15" or "which hosts allow adult content" that can be answered through our database.

**The website will need:**
- Fast searchable/filterable table (probably with JS filtering)
- SEO-friendly individual pages for each hosting company
- Comparison functionality (compare 2-3 hosts side by side)
- Mobile responsive
- Easy to update when hosting companies change pricing/features

## CURRENT TASK: DATA COLLECTION

Right now, we are ONLY focused on collecting accurate data. Website development comes later.

---

## DATA SOURCE

The CSV file with headers and company list is already in the project folder. Use it as reference for the column structure.

---

## DATA STORAGE

**Do NOT just save as CSV.**

Choose the most appropriate data format/structure for our end goal (a searchable, filterable comparison website). Consider:
- JSON files (one per company, or one master file)
- SQLite database
- Structured markdown files
- Or whatever format you think will work best for building the website later

Explain your choice and set up the data structure accordingly.

## YOUR TASK

**IMPORTANT: Do ONE company at a time. Do NOT proceed to the next company until I confirm.**

**START WITH GODADDY ONLY.**

### Process:

### Step 1: Read the CSV file from the project folder to understand the column structure

### Step 2: Set up the optimal data storage format for our website goal

### Step 3: Research GoDaddy and fill all fields using this priority:
1. **Official GoDaddy website** — check these pages:
   - Main pricing page: https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting
   - Features/specs pages
   - Terms of Service / Acceptable Use Policy
   - Support/contact page
   - Data center/infrastructure page
   
2. **Google search** for specific data points (e.g., "GoDaddy renewal pricing", "GoDaddy server locations", "GoDaddy inode limit")

3. **Third-party sites** for ratings:
   - Trustpilot
   - G2
   - BBB (Better Business Bureau)

4. **Web hosting review sites** for cross-referencing technical specs

### Step 4: Fill in the data following these formatting rules:

**Data formatting standards:**
- Yes/No fields: Use true/false (boolean) or "Yes"/"No" depending on your chosen format
- Pricing: Numbers only, no currency symbols (assume USD)
- Unlimited values: Use "Unlimited" or null with a flag, whatever fits your schema
- Not available/not disclosed: Use null or "NOT_FOUND"
- Multiple values: Use arrays if JSON, or semicolon-separated if flat format
- Dates: Use YYYY-MM-DD format

**Priority fields to find (these are our competitive advantage):**
- Shared Hosting Monthly (Renewal) — not just promo price
- Inode Limit
- Money-Back Guarantee Exclusions
- Account Suspension Policy
- Suspension Warning Period
- Adult Content Allowed
- Gambling Sites Allowed
- Cryptocurrency Sites Allowed
- Hidden Fees Notes
- Backup Restore Fee

### Step 5: Save GoDaddy's data in your chosen format

### Step 6: STOP and show me:
1. What data format you chose and why
2. Summary of what you found for GoDaddy
3. Any fields that were NOT_FOUND

Wait for my confirmation before proceeding to the next company.
